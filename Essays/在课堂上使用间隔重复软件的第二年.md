# 在课堂上使用间隔重复软件的第二年

This is a follow-up to [last year's report](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/mfm/a_year_of_spaced_repetition_software_in_the/). Here, I will talk about my successes and failures using Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) in the classroom for a second year. The year's not over yet, but I have reasons for reporting early that should become clear in a subsequent post. A third post will then follow, and together these will constitute a small sequence exploring classroom SRS and the adjacent ideas that bubble up when I think deeply about teaching.

这是对[去年的报告](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/mfm/a_year_of_spaced_repetition_software_in_the/)的跟进。在这里，我将谈一谈我第二年在课堂上使用间隔重复软件（SRS）的成功和失败之处。这一年还没有结束，但我有理由提前报告，这在随后的文章中应该会变得很清楚。第三篇文章将随后发表，这些文章将构成一个探索课堂 SRS 的小系列，以及当我深入思考教学问题时涌现的相关想法。

## Summary

## 摘要

I experienced net negative progress this year in my efforts to improve classroom instruction via spaced repetition software. While this is mostly attributable to shifts in my personal priorities, I have also identified a number of additional failure modes for classroom SRS, as well as additional shortcomings of Anki for this use case. My experiences also showcase some fundamental challenges to teaching-in-general that SRS depressingly spotlights without being any less susceptible to. Regardless, I am more bullish than ever about the *potential* for classroom SRS, and will lay out a detailed vision for what it can be in the next post.

今年，我在通过间隔重复软件改进课堂教学的努力中经历了净负面的进展。虽然这主要是由于我个人优先事项的转变，但我也发现了课堂 SRS 的一些额外的失败模式，以及 Anki 在这些用例中的额外缺点。我的经验也展示了一般教学中的一些基本挑战，SRS 令人沮丧地指出了这些挑战，但却不容易受到影响。无论如何，我比以往任何时候都更看好课堂 SRS 的*潜力*，并将在下一篇文章中对它的前景做出详细描述。

### Prologue

### 序言

You might want to at least skim last year's [report](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/mfm/a_year_of_spaced_repetition_software_in_the/), even if you've read it before. My job description is unchanged, and my core approach to SRS stayed the same. I will not be going into those details today.

你至少可以略读一下去年的[报告](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/mfm/a_year_of_spaced_repetition_software_in_the/)，即使你以前读过。我的工作描述没有改变，我对待 SRS 的核心方法也保持不变。今天我就不谈这些细节了。

Also, you'll probably find much of this report disappointing for reasons that have nothing to do with SRS itself and everything to do with me—reasons I will now invite you to understand with a philosophical introspective. If gazing into my navel really isn't your thing, just skip the next section.

此外，你可能会发现这份报告的大部分内容令人失望，原因与 SRS 本身无关，而与我有关——现在我将邀请你通过哲学的内省来理解这些原因。如果你真的不喜欢我的钻牛角尖，那就跳过下一节。

### Autopilot years

### 自动驾驶数年

The commonly appreciated upside of being a public schoolteacher in the United States is having more days off and greater job security than most workers. Less commonly appreciated is that, once you've got things figured out, you probably don't need to put in tons of extra hours. You can mostly leave your work at work.

在美国，作为一名公立学校教师，人们普遍认识到的好处是比大多数工人有更多的休息日和更大的工作保障。很少被人注意到的是，一旦你把事情搞清楚了，你可能不需要投入大量的额外时间。你基本上可以把你的工作留在工作日。

So what do you do with the time?

那你怎么打发时间呢？

Good teachers usually direct a lot of that back to the students. They coach a sport, or sponsor a club. They leave detailed feedback on essays. They tutor.

好的老师通常会把很多东西反馈给学生。他们指导一项运动，或赞助一个俱乐部。他们对论文留下详细的反馈。他们进行辅导。

I've done most of those things, but my personal preference is to reinvest in my core classroom offerings by improving my content and tooling. On top of some smaller tweaks, I usually pick one big project every year that will add a new layer of awesome to what I do. One year, it was better writing mini-lessons and example content to go with them. Another, it was visual vocab slides with real-world example sentences. Twice, it was improved systems for grading and classroom management, facilitated by my hobbyist programming skills.

我已经做了这些事情中的大部分，但我个人的偏好是通过改进我的内容和工具，对我的核心课堂课程进行再投资。除了一些小的调整之外，我通常每年都会选择一个大项目，为我的工作增添一层新的精彩。有一年的项目是更好地编写迷你课程和与之配套的示例内容。另一个项目是带有真实世界例句的视觉词汇幻灯片。有两次，是通过我业余的编程技能，改进了评分和课堂管理的系统。

Not all such projects are successful. My first management system, for example, was an unworkable mess, necessitating the System 2.0 I brought on line the year after and have used ever since. But lest I drift uselessly on waves self-doubt and shifting interests, I pre-commit to seeing a project through for the year, aborting only if I have strongly compelling evidence that I'm wasting my time.[^1]

并非所有这样的项目都是成功的。例如，我的第一个管理系统是一个无法运行的烂摊子，导致我不得不在第二年上线了系统2.0，并一直使用到现在。但是，为了避免我在自我怀疑和兴趣转移的浪潮中无用地漂流，我预先承诺在一年内完成一个项目，只有当我有强有力的证据表明我在浪费时间时才会放弃。

Last year, my pet project was the SRS experiment. The daily commitment to card creation, on top of everything else I do, was substantial. For this year, it would have been natural for my project to be a similar commitment to improving those cards and the the lessons that go with them.

去年，我最喜欢的项目是 SRS 实验。在我所做的一切之上，每天对卡片创作的承诺是非常大的。今年，我的项目很自然地成为一个类似的承诺，即改进这些卡片和与之相关的课程。

**It didn't happen.**

**没有发生。**

The commonly-appreciated downsides of being a public schoolteacher in the US are low income and emotional weathering. The intensities fluctuate, but the effects are cumulative.

在美国，作为一名公立学校教师，人们普遍认识到的缺点是收入低和情绪化。其强度是波动的，但其影响是累积的。

Which brings us to those years where a teacher pours little or nothing back into their job, pressing “replay” on whatever they did last year and staying relatively detached. I've never heard a teacher use the term “autopilot year”, but every teacher who's been around long enough knows exactly what I'm talking about and has probably had at least two.

这就给我们带来了那些年，教师很少或根本没有回到他们的工作中， "回放" 他们去年所做的一切，并保持相对冷漠。我从来没有听说过一个老师使用 "自动驾驶年" 这个词，但每一个工作时间足够长的老师都知道我在说什么，而且可能至少有两个。

I discourage you from judging them for it. A good teacher on autopilot is better for your kid than the flailing rookie who takes their place when they switch careers. Sure, there are bad teachers on autopilot, but you should prefer they stay that way; the only thing worse than a bad teacher on autopilot is a bad teacher who is *not* detached, and actively imposes on the self-motivated students who might have otherwise learned something on their own.[^2]

我不鼓励你因此而评判他们。一个自动驾驶的好老师对你的孩子来说，比他们转行时接替他们位置的菜鸟更好。当然，也有自动驾驶的坏老师，但你应该希望他们保持这种状态；唯一比自动驾驶的坏老师更糟糕的是，一个坏老师*不离不弃*，主动强加给那些自我激励的学生，否则他们可能会自己学到东西。

Life happens, and even this job is still just a job. Maybe your kid's teacher seems a bit checked out because they're taking care of an ailing family member. Maybe they're running a home business to fill the income gap left when you voted down the tax override. Maybe they're still reeling from the emotional damage of the student who viciously jabbed at their worst insecurities for most of last year.

生活会发生，即使这份工作也只是一份工作。也许你孩子的老师看起来有点不在状态，因为他们正在照顾生病的家庭成员。也许他们正在经营家庭生意，以填补你投票否决税收超支时留下的收入差距。也许他们还在为去年大部分时间里恶狠狠地刺伤他们最不安全感的学生的情感伤害而感到不安。

Maybe they're like me, not doing any of those things at the moment but certainly feeling pinched by expenses that climb faster than his salary; feeling like he doesn't quite *need* to switch careers but needs to feel like he has the option; feeling like it's time to reinvent his approach to teaching but unable to execute on his ideas; feeling like he should pour every spare minute into aggressively levelling up his programming skills, and then doing so, on the theory that [“If you don't know what you need, take power.”](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/cl/final_words/)

也许他们和我一样，目前没有做这些事情，但肯定会感到被比他的工资攀升得更快的开支所压制；感觉他不太*需要转换职业，但需要感觉他有这个选择；感觉是时候重塑他的教学方法了，但无法施行他的想法；感觉他应该倾注每一分闲暇时间，积极地提升他的编程技能，然后这样做，理论上是["如果你不知道你需要什么，就拿权力。"](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/cl/final_words/)

So no, I haven't done much of what I set out to do in my SRS goals list from last year. I didn't rework very many of my cards. I didn't take a less linear and more opportunistic approach to introducing new content. I didn't even reduce the *number* of cards!

所以，我没有做很多我在去年的SRS目标列表中设定的事情。我没有重新制作很多卡片。我没有采取更少的线性和更多的机会主义方法来引入新内容。我甚至没有减少卡片的*数量*！

Because, in the end, these tweaks began to feel far too small, like cobblestones on a path terminating in a local maxima where I'm doing “pretty cool” things in my classroom that no one else will replicate. I've been down that road before, and I'm not in the mood.[^3]

因为，到最后，这些调整开始觉得太小了，就像一条小路上的鹅卵石，终止于一个局部的最高点，在那里我在教室里做着其他人不会复制的“非常酷”的事情。我以前也走过这条路，但我现在没有这个心情。

It's time to go big or go elsewhere, and upgrading *myself* has felt like the only way to make that happen. Course improvements would have to wait.

现在是大干一场或去其他地方的时候了，而提升*我自己*感觉是实现这一目标的唯一途径。课程的改进将不得不等待。

### Standardized test results

### 标准化测试结果

State test results for last year's students came back eventually, and were disappointingly inconclusive. Being a brand new test, the reports were sparser than I was used to. There was no “value-added” analysis to show me whether expectations were beat for my particular students (an area I have historically done well in), only a broad comparison to the students of other teachers in my department. My classes' average was only marginally higher than that of our most similar peer classes—a difference I would put handily within the margin of error, as we often seen very uneven distributions of talent between classes. The most noticeable signal was of my classes producing more outlying high scores than would otherwise be expected, but that's a small *n*.

去年学生的州测试结果最终出来了，令人失望的是没有结论。作为一个全新的测试，报告比我所习惯的要少。没有 "增值 " 分析来告诉我，我的特定学生（我在这个领域历来做得很好）是否达到了预期目标，只有与我所在部门的其他教师的学生进行广泛比较。我的班级的平均成绩只比我们最相似的同届班级高一点——我认为这个差距在误差范围之内，因为我们经常看到班级之间的人才分布非常不均。最明显的信号是我的班级产生了比预期更多的高分，但这是一个小样本。

I'm not going to make up stories explaining why the scores might be disappointing because I could just as easily tell stories that would have explained a stronger signal of success.[^4]

我不会编故事来解释为什么分数可能会令人失望，因为我同样可以很容易地讲故事来解释更强烈的成功信号.

Still, I think it says something that my classes continue to perform with increasingly minimal note-taking and homework. Certainly, the student experience is improved without harming test outcomes. I'm the English teacher students beg to have again (and occasionally manipulate the system into getting). A teacher can be effective without being liked, but positivity has real advantages. Certainly, I enjoy *teaching* more when my students are having a good time. Creativity and connection-making are also known to be enhanced by a positive mood (at the expense of vigilance and accuracy).[^5]

尽管如此，我认为这说明我的课程继续以越来越少的笔记和家庭作业来表现。当然，在不影响考试结果的情况下，学生的体验会得到改善。我是英语老师，学生们又乞求拥有（偶尔操纵系统进入）。一个老师不被人喜欢也能很有效，但积极性有真正的优势。当然，当我的学生玩得开心时，我更喜欢教书。人们也知道，积极的情绪会增强创造力和建立联系（以牺牲警惕性和准确性为代价）.

不过，我认为这说明了一些问题，我的班级在笔记和家庭作业越来越少的情况下仍然表现出色。当然，在没有损害考试结果的情况下，学生的体验得到了改善。我是学生们渴望再次拥有的英语老师（偶尔也会操纵系统来获得）。一个老师可以在不被人喜欢的情况下变得有效，但积极性有真正的优势。当然，当我的学生玩得开心时，我更喜欢*教书*。众所周知，创造性和建立联系也会因积极的情绪而得到加强（以牺牲警惕性和准确性为代价）。

I can't also help being cynical here, though. **It may be that what we do in class simply doesn't matter on the test, because the state is evaluating softer skills that derive more from raw intelligence and [pleasure-reading habits](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/ToRead.pdf)** than from anything I can teach them.

不过，我在这里也忍不住愤世嫉俗。**也许我们在课堂上所做的一切在考试中根本不重要，因为国家正在评估那些更多来自纯智力和[快乐阅读习惯](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/ToRead.pdf)**的软技能，而不是来自我可以教他们的东西。

Just before classes started up for the new school year, I was given an impromptu opportunity to present SRS and what I'd done with it to most of the other teachers in my department. They seemed interested and supportive, asking some good questions, including about implementation details for starting up classroom decks of their own.

就在新学年开学前，我得到了一个临时的机会，向我所在部门的大多数其他老师介绍 SRS 和我用它做的事情。他们似乎很感兴趣，也很支持，问了一些很好的问题，包括关于启动他们自己的课堂牌组的实施细节。

**Not one of them tried it.**

**他们中没有一个人试过。**

I wasn't surprised, and I certainly don't fault them for it. I'll get more into why in my next post, but over the weeks that followed the main impression I got was that they saw classroom SRS as being at the teacherly equivalent of a low [technology readiness level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level); they were glad someone like me was experimenting with it, and hoped it would become a more obvious win down the road.

我一点也不惊讶，我当然不会因此责怪他们。我将在下一篇文章中进一步说明原因，但在接下来的几周里，我得到的主要印象是，他们认为课堂SRS相当于教师的低（技术准备水平）(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level); 他们很高兴有像我这样的人在试验，并希望这将成为一个更明显的胜利的道路。

我并不感到惊讶，当然我也不会因此而责怪他们。我将在下一篇文章中进一步说明原因，但在随后的几周里，我得到的主要印象是，他们认为课堂上的 SRS 在教师方面相当于低[技术准备水平](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level)；他们很高兴像我这样的人在试验它，并希望这将成为一个更明显的胜利方法。

I did come close to getting a couple of teachers to at least try SRS for their *personal* use when I talked about how I was using it to learn my students' names before I had met them—as they had seen me doing between meetings.

当我谈到我是如何在见到学生之前就用它来了解他们的名字时，我确实接近于让几个老师至少为他们的*个人*使用而尝试 SRS——他们在会议之间看到我这样做。

### Names and faces

### 姓名和面孔

I'm not someone who organically picks up people's names very well; without some kind of a system in place I can go embarrassingly far into the year relying on my seating chart. Pre-learning names with Anki is something I had seen talked about on this forum [before](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/e26/who_wants_to_start_an_important_startup/782v), so I tried it.

我不是一个能很好地记住别人名字的人；如果没有某种系统，我可能会在这一年里尴尬地依赖我的座位表。用 Anki 预先学习名字是我[以前](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/e26/who_wants_to_start_an_important_startup/782v)在这个论坛上看到的，所以我试了一下。

I had five calendar days between the time I could access the rosters for my classes and the first day of those classes. Our district's roster management system has images on file for students that have been in the district for at least a year or so.

从我可以访问我班级的名册到给这些班级上课的第一天，我有五天时间。我们区的花名册管理系统有在本区至少一年左右的学生的图像档案。

After subtracting the photoless newcomers and the students I had last year, I had about 120 names I could learn. It was straightforward (if grindy) to use the standard Windows image capture “snipping” tool to paste these images into Anki cards.

在减去没有照片的新人和我去年的学生后，我有大约120个名字可以学习。使用标准的Windows图像捕捉 "剪裁 "工具将这些图像粘贴到Anki卡片上是很简单的（尽管很麻烦）。

I was striving for a high level of automaticity, as well as both first and last name recognition. So I did multiple daily sessions. **In total, I spent about 3.5 hours, spread out over that 5 day period**. This doesn't include the time I spent making the decks (40 min maybe?) or the much shorter review sessions I continued to do after school started.

我一直在努力争取高水平的自动能力，以及对名字和姓氏的识别。因此，我每天进行多次训练。**在这 5 天时间里，我总共花了大约 3.5 个小时**。这还不包括我花在制作卡片上的时间（大概 40 分钟），也不包括开学后继续进行的更短的复习会话。

For students who resembled their cards, I could (and occasionally did) greet them by name as they walked in my door that first day, intentionally adding uncertainty to my voice to cut down on the creepiness quotient.

对于那些与他们的卡片相似的学生，当他们第一天走进我的门时，我可以（偶尔也会这样做）问候他们的名字，故意在我的声音中加入不确定性，以减少他们的恐惧感。

There are some obvious inefficiencies to pre-learning. Not everyone looks like their file photo, or goes by a name that resembles their legal name. And rosters tend to fluctuate that first week.

预先学习有一些明显的低效率。不是每个人都像他们的档案照片，或用一个与他们的法定姓名相似的名字。而且第一周的名册往往会出现波动。

Will I do it again? I might. It helped us hit the ground running. Historically, I would pad the first couple days with some independent work just to give me a chance to stare at them, which is awkward for everyone. Name learning also fits with that impending start-of-year mood where I often feel less prepared than I am, and seek out compensating tasks. But 4+ hours is not an insignificant investment, and there were still a lot of names I couldn't know for lack of photos.

我还会这样做吗？我可能会。它帮助我们打好基础。从历史上看，我会在头几天用一些独立的工作来填补，只是为了让我有机会盯着他们，这对每个人来说都是尴尬的。学习名字也符合那种即将开始的年头的心情，在这种情况下，我常常觉得自己的准备不足，并寻求补偿任务。但 4 个多小时不是一个微不足道的投资，还是有很多名字我因为缺乏照片而无法知道。

I think my preference would be to wait for the first day of classes and use an app that has you take a picture of, say, five students at a time holding up name cards, automagically turning this into SRS cards.

我想我更倾向于等到上课的第一天，使用一个应用，让你拍一张照片，比如说，每次有五个学生举着名片，自动把这个变成SRS卡。

Someone go make that.

有人去做吧。

### The sapping seduction of legacy cards

### 遗留卡片的消耗诱惑

Having an autopilot year was disturbingly easy as far as our class Anki decks went. Last year I had made sure to tag everything, and to organize the archives a bit before summer. Pulling out the right cards for a day's instruction this year was thus the work of a few clicks.

就我们班的 Anki 牌组而言，自动驾驶年是令人不安的。去年，我确保给所有的东西都打上标签，并在暑假前整理了一下档案。因此，今年为一天的教学抽出正确的卡片只需点击几下就可以了。

But **a wealth of existing cards makes new card creation feel onerous by comparison**. Worse, you're reluctant to modify a lesson if it might “break” some existing cards. This could definitely have pulled me towards stagnation even if I hadn't made a conscious decision to coast this year.

但是，**丰富的现有卡片使新卡片的创建相比之下显得很繁重**。更糟的是，你不愿意修改课程，如果课程可能会“破坏”一些现有的卡片，你就不愿意修改它。肯定会把我拉向停滞不前的境地，即使我今年没有做出一个明智的决定。

There's also a related problem here, which is that **it's harder to stay excited about cards you've seen dozens of times**. Cracks began to show in the affable MC personality I wear for review sessions. That “apathetic third” of students I talked about last year? It's more like the apathetic supermajority when I haven't brought my 'A' game. The lesson here is a general one, I'm sure: **charisma is a poor foundation on which to build a lasting system**.

这里还有一个相关的问题，那就是你很难对你看过几十次的卡片保持兴奋。我在复习课上穿的和蔼可亲的司仪的个性开始出现裂痕。我去年提到的那个“冷漠的三分之一”学生？这更像是当我还没有带来我的“A”游戏时的冷漠的超级多数。这里的教训是一个普遍的问题，我相信：人格魅力是建立一个持久体系的基础。

这里还有一个相关的问题，那就是**对你已经看过几十次的牌更难保持兴奋**。我在复习课上穿的和蔼可亲的主持人性格开始出现裂痕。我去年谈到的 "冷漠的三分之一 "的学生？当我没有带着我的 "A "游戏时，它更像是冷漠的超级多数人。我相信，这里的教训是普遍的：**魅力是建立一个持久系统的糟糕基础**。

### Missing out: creation

### 遗漏：创作

The aversion I've felt to making new cards for my students this year is actually kind of funny in light of the fact that I've made some 3,000 cards for my personal use over the same period, and that these, being more technical (programming), were mostly harder to write. I think some of that hesitancy stems from a growing apprehension that **I'm not doing students any great favor by writing all of their cards for them**.

今年我对为我的学生制作新卡片感到厌恶，这实际上有点可笑，因为在同一时期，我为个人使用制作了大约 3000 张卡片，而这些卡片由于技术性更强（编程），大多比较难写。我认为这种犹豫源于一种日益增长的忧虑，即**我为学生写所有的卡片并不是在帮他们的忙**。

There is much to be said for figuring out how to take an idea that is new to you and put it into concise form. As I continue to think of ways to reduce the note-taking I make my students do, I'm also cognizant of the fact that I rarely take notes for myself anymore—I just go straight to making Anki cards.

要想知道如何把一个对你来说很陌生的想法变成简明扼要的形式，是很有必要的。当我继续思考如何减少我让学生做的笔记时，我也意识到一个事实，即我很少为自己做笔记——我只是直接去做 Anki 卡片。

But I've also gained a deeper appreciation for the difficulty of creating a truly *good* card, so much so that I'm hesitant to trust teenagers to do it even remotely well.

但我也对创作一张真正*好*的卡片的难度有了更深的体会，以至于我不太相信青少年能做好这一点。

So the question I keep asking myself is how to give students most of the benefits of participating in the card creation process without sacrificing the time-efficiency and card quality that come from a professional writing the cards. It's thorny. But having turned it over in my head enough times now, I think I have some answers (which will have to wait until the next post.)

因此，我一直问自己的问题是，如何在不牺牲专业人员写卡片的时间效率和卡片质量的情况下，给学生提供参与卡片制作过程的大部分好处。这是一个棘手的问题。但是，在我的脑海中翻来覆去地想了很多次之后，我想我有了一些答案（这要等到下一篇文章。

### Missing out: free association

### 遗漏：自由联想

Another benefit they're missing out in is the free association time I get on the exercise walks where I do much of my personal study. Minute-for-minute, I only get about half as many cards done this way, but as I pause reviews to run for a stretch, negotiate challenging terrain, or appreciate my surroundings, I'm also mulling over the cards I've last seen and letting connections form between them—and between anything else I've been thinking about.

他们错过的另一个好处是我在散步锻炼时得到的自由联想时间，我在那里做了很多个人学习。一分种又一分钟，我只完成了一半的卡片，但当我暂停复习，跑了一段路，走了一段具有挑战性的地形，或欣赏周围的环境时，我也在思考我最后看到的卡片，让它们之间以及我一直在思考的其他东西之间形成联系。

This is a strange habit that works largely unconsciously, and one I'm not sure I would have thought to *intentionally* cultivate but for an older [Kahneman](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) quote in my personal deck:

> An idea that has been activated does not merely evoke one other idea. It evokes many ideas, which in turn activate others. Furthermore, only a few of the activated ideas will register in consciousness. Most of the work of associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves.

这是一个奇怪的习惯，在很大程度上是无意识地发挥作用的，如果不是因为我个人卡组中的一句较早的[卡尼曼](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)的话，我不确定自己是否会想到*有意地培养这种习惯：

>一个被激活的想法并不只是唤起另一个想法。它唤起了许多想法，反过来又激活了其他想法。此外，只有少数被激活的思想会在意识中记录。联想思维的大部分工作都是无声的，隐藏在我们的意识之外。

This year, I've grown to appreciate that **the subconscious is a black-box back-office you can deliberately prime** with study cards; it will reliably return assorted insights when given enough raw materials and workspace.

今年，我逐渐意识到，**潜意识是一个黑箱的后台，你可以有意地用学习卡片来激发它**；只要给它足够的原材料和工作空间，它就会可靠地返回各种见解。

I actually added a card I couldn't answer the other day, on a hunch that I might figure it out over the course of a walk once it had popped up a few times.

实际上，前几天我加了一张我无法回答的卡片，因为我有一种预感，一旦它出现了几次，我可能会在散步的过程中弄明白它。

Success.

成功。

How to give students *this* benefit? That's a tough one. Worth thinking about, though. Worth thinking about… [lowers phone, takes in sunset].

如何让学生得到*这个*好处？这是一个难题。不过，值得考虑。值得考虑的是……[放下手机，欣赏夕阳]。

### Tiers of availability

### 可用性分层

It's also clearer than ever to me that being able to remember something when prompted is not the only worthy end-goal for a card.

我也比以往任何时候都清楚，能够在被提示时记住一些东西，并不是卡片唯一值得追求的最终目标。

Sure, for some types of information, it is indeed enough that, given a very specific prompt, you can return a corresponding fact. World capitals, for example. Vocab definitions (while reading). Special-purpose algorithms. Usernames and passwords for important-but-infrequently-used services.[^6]

当然，对于某些类型的信息，只要给出一个非常具体的提示，就可以返回相应的事实。例如，世界各国首都。词汇定义（阅读时）。专用算法。重要但不常使用的服务的用户名和密码。

But for most of the information actually worth committing to memory instead of Google, we want it to spontaneously fly out of us without any specific prompting whenever we're in a context where it might be useful. Wise quotations. Multi-purpose algorithms. Vocab words (while writing).

但对于大多数真正值得记忆而不是 Google 的信息，我们希望它能在我们处于可能有用的环境中时，不经任何特定的提示而自发地飞出来。智慧的引用。多用途算法。词汇（在写作时）。

For some information, the most valuable thing it can be doing is bouncing around in your near-subconscious, making itself a target for collision and fusion with other ideas. If you're looking for an analogy to nuclear physics (and why wouldn't you be?) think of this as increasing the [neutron cross section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_cross_section) of an idea.

对于一些信息来说，它最有价值的事情就是在你的近潜意识中跳动，使自己成为与其他想法碰撞和融合的目标。如果你想找一个与核物理学的类比（你为什么不找呢？），可以把这看作是增加一个想法的[中子截面](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_cross_section)。

For still other information, you want it to retrieve itself instantly as a matter of reflex before you even become consciously aware of it. This is true where speed of recall is critical, and in situations where conscious recognition is unhelpful or a point of failure. Think grammar error recognition. Word fragment meanings. Muscle memory tasks. [Implementation intentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention). (aka Trigger Action Plans).

对于其他信息，你希望它能在你有意识地意识到它之前，作为一个反射性的问题，立即检索出来。在回忆的速度至关重要的情况下，以及在有意识的识别是无益的或失败的情况下，这是真的。想想语法错误的识别。词汇片段的含义。肌肉记忆任务。[执行意图](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention)。(又称触发行动计划)。

The thing is, **different levels of availability require different rehearsal commitments**. I've not seen any explicit support for varied automaticity goals in Anki or the other spaced repetition programs I've played with. The best I can do is try to decide on a review-by-review basis whether I should set the next interval of a given card more conservatively than suggested.

问题是，**不同的可用性水平需要不同的排练承诺**。在 Anki 或其他我玩过的间隔重复程序中，我没有看到任何对不同自动性目标的明确支持。我所能做的就是在逐个复习的基础上决定我是否应该把某张卡片的下一个间隔设置得比建议的更保守。

I find that **cards needing rapid reflexive recall are best kept very short**. This lets you review them aggressively without a huge time commitment, and also makes them more likely to bubble out of your head in response to relevant stimuli.

我发现，**需要快速反射性回忆的卡片最好保持简短**。这可以让你积极地复习，而不需要投入大量的时间，同时也使它们更有可能在相关的刺激下从你的头脑中冒出来。

My existing classroom decks predate these insights, and could definitely use some optimization.

我现有的课程牌组早于这些见解，绝对可以使用一些优化。

### Crickets and chihuahuas

### 一声不吭和吉娃娃

I've seen that the particular mix of students you get in a given class makes an enormous difference in student buy-in.

我已经看到，在一个特定的班级里，学生的特殊组合对学生的认同产生了巨大的影响。

I have one morning class where eyelids hang low, indifference runs high, and we can go several Anki cards in a row without anybody raising a hand. **Crickets herald a death spiral** where we can't review as many cards in a given period of time, and where don't spend as much time reviewing because the energy falls off more rapidly.

我有一节上午的课，眼皮低垂，漠不关心，我们可以连续过好几张 Anki 卡片而没有人举手。**一声不吭预示着恶性循环**，我们不能在限定时间内复习那么多的卡片，也不能花那么多时间复习，因为精力下降得更快。

I have another class for whom Anki is the highlight of their day, and they beg to spend a greater portion of class doing it. I can go through 15 cards without needing to call on the same volunteer twice. These students are my little Anki chihuahuas, and to see what would happen I decided early on to let that class stay caught up with with the deck more often, even if it meant cutting into other planned activities.

我有另一个班级，对他们来说，Anki 是他们一天中的亮点，他们恳求用更多的时间来做这个。我可以过 15 张卡片，而不需要叫上同一个志愿者两次。这些学生是我的小 Anki 吉娃娃，为了看看会发生什么，我很早就决定让这个班的学生更经常地跟上这副牌组，即使这意味着要削减其他计划中的活动。

A natural experiment, you ask? Nah. They self-selected, and are my only section of that grade level. Has it done them extra good? I'm not so sure. But I've learned a few things.

你问的是一个自然实验？不是。他们是自我选择的，而且是我的那个年级的唯一部分。这对他们有额外的好处吗？我不太确定。但我已经学到了一些东西。

### Here comes a new failure mode!

### 新的失败模式出现了！

Newly identified, at least. I've had a hunch, but now I know for sure that many students see Anki only as a way to get validation for ideas they remember, rather than as a way to re-learn information they had forgotten. This is most visible among the chihuahuas, where a number of students have a reputation for “owning” particular cards, answering them with cultivated panache and expressing indignation if someone else “steals” them.

至少是新发现的。我有预感，但现在我确信许多学生认为Anki只是一种验证他们所记住的想法的方法，而不是一种重新学习他们忘记的信息的方法。这一点在奇瓦瓦人中最为明显，许多学生以“拥有”特定的卡片而闻名，他们用文雅的装腔作势回答卡片，如果有人“偷走”卡片，他们会表示愤慨。

This is entertaining to preside over, but isn't exactly the *point*. I'm glad Anki locks in the cards they know, but it seems that **if they didn't know the card the first time it came up, they'll probably \*never\* know it**.

主持这个会议很有趣，但这并不是重点。我很高兴Anki锁定了他们知道的牌，但似乎**如果他们第一次出现的时候不知道，他们可能永远不会知道**。

I could draw a couple of lessons from this. 1) That the “vivid memory, card ready” mantra I devised last year is even more important than I thought. 2) Nothing short of pressing the red button will do for a student who has forgotten a fact.

我可以从中吸取一些教训。1） 我去年设计的“生动记忆，卡片就绪”的咒语比我想象的更重要。2） 对一个忘记了一个事实的学生来说，只按一下红色按钮是不行的。

### Horizontal integration

### 横向一体化

From that same class of enthusiasts I've seen another pattern emerge. **Students strong in cards with a common theme tend to take more interest in other similar cards**. They become Grammar Dude. Little Miss Word Fragment. Chief Petty Officer of Words-That-Sound-Vaguely-Like-Genitals.

从同一类狂热者身上，我看到了另一种模式的出现**对主题相同的卡片感兴趣的学生往往对其他类似的卡片更感兴趣。他们成了语法专家。小漏字片段。听上去像生殖器的话的军士长。

Alas, this does not seem to help their interest in other categories, and actually seems to work against it. Turns out many of my chihuahuas are actually [hedgehogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox).

唉，这似乎无助于他们对其他类别的兴趣，实际上似乎与之相反。原来我的很多吉娃娃都是刺猬(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox).

### Absolute zero

### 绝对的零

A few of my students have an impressive, empirically verified zero absorption rate. I am not exaggerating. I can compare pre-test performance to post-test performance and find absolutely no improvement, even with easy objective content that we covered extensively.

我的一些学生有一个令人印象深刻的，经验性的零吸收率。我并不夸张。我可以将测试前的性能与测试后的性能进行比较，发现绝对没有改进，即使是我们广泛介绍的简单客观的内容。

SRS has nothing in particular to do with this, but it does shine a soul-crushing spotlight on it. A student can show up every day, take every note you give them, look like they're paying attention over weeks of Anki review… and test exactly as well as if they'd spent every minute in the bathroom doing their hair instead.

SRS与此没有什么特别的关系，但它确实在它身上闪耀着一道令人心碎的聚光灯。一个学生可以每天出现，记下你给他们的每一个笔记，看起来他们在Anki复习的几周里都很专注……测试的准确程度就像他们花每一分钟在浴室里做头发一样。

### Stuck in neutral

### 卡在空档

Stand back as I invoke the name of the adversary, She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Inspired, the Angel of Trite, the Rock of our Stagnation, the Blahgiver, the Alpha and the Neutrogena. **Her name is Apathy**, and she doesn't give a shit.

当我召唤敌人的名字时，退后一点，她将不会受到鼓舞，陈腐的天使，我们停滞的岩石，布莱希弗，阿尔法和露得清**她的名字叫冷漠，她一点也不在乎。

You know how you can zone out and review something three or four times without processing it, but then you realize, kick yourself in gear, and engage your faculties, pushing it into your mind?

你知道你如何在没有处理的情况下，把某件事分出来复习三四遍，但是你意识到，你要振作起来，发挥你的能力，把它放在你的脑海里？

You have to *care*, just a little bit. To keep it up, you have to care a little bit more. It's not always easy to find and sustain that spark of caring, because the learning target might be only indirectly instrumental to your goals. But you can do it.

你得关心一下，就一点点。为了保持下去，你必须多关心一点。找到并保持这种关心的火花并不总是容易的，因为学习目标可能只是间接地帮助你实现目标。但你能做到。

But what if the vending machine stopped carrying your [Juice of Sapho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMBb_tPPA8E&ab_channel=MrJacobunny)? What if you lost your Care Bear Stare?

但是如果自动售货机停止运送你的[沙波果汁]呢(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMBb_tPPA8E&ab_channel=MrJacobunny)? 如果你失去了照顾怎么办？

A large fraction of teenagers lack the ability to direct caring at will. They can be made to understand why they *should* care about something in school, but there are too many layers of indirection between it and the impulses that can actually *move* them. You can chalk this deficiency up to short [time preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference) and trouble [delaying gratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification), if you want. You can even blame the more obvious fact that, at any given moment, a teenager is probably sleep-deprived, hungry, emotionally preoccupied, or some combination of the three. But whatever their reasons, they Just. Don't. Care.

很大一部分青少年缺乏随意指导护理的能力。他们可以理解为什么他们应该关心学校里的一些事情，但是在这些事情和能够真正感动他们的冲动之间有太多的间接因素。你可以把这个缺陷归结为短期[时间偏好](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference)麻烦[拖延满足](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification)，如果你愿意的话。你甚至可以责怪一个更明显的事实，在任何特定的时刻，一个青少年很可能是睡眠不足，饥饿，情绪困扰，或是这三者的结合。但不管他们的理由是什么，他们只是。不要。小心。

Some, I fear, are so in thrall to Our Lady of the Vacuous Conception that they don't even know where to find the part of their brain that *tries*. Maybe they never did. Is it possible? Could some people be born without the ability to mentally engage? I almost feel silly asking, like I'm ranting about a pandemic of [philosophical zombies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie). But I've *seen* things, all right?

我担心，有些人是如此地被我们的虚空观念的女士所束缚，以至于他们甚至不知道在哪里可以找到他们大脑中尝试的那部分。也许他们从来没有。有可能吗？有些人天生就没有精神上的参与能力吗？我几乎觉得问这个问题很愚蠢，就像我在大肆宣扬一种流行的[哲学僵尸](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie). 但我见过很多事，好吗？

Where does classroom SRS fit in a dystopian world where the High and Flighty One walks abroad, claiming our youth as her disciples of indifference?

在一个反乌托邦的世界里，高傲和轻浮的人走到国外，声称我们的年轻人是冷漠的门徒，教室在哪里？

It doesn't fit well when the cards will go on without them, as happens when we do Anki together as a class. This doesn't make SRS any worse than all of the other things they won't do (like the things it replaced), but it doesn't make it better, either. I had very good reasons for starting out with a whole-class model rather than a 1:1 model, and those reasons haven't disappeared. But **I don't think I can expect SRS to significantly improve the outcomes of apathetic learners without 1:1 learner-app interaction**. And I don't want to keep writing those kids off.

当卡片没有它们的时候就不适合了，就像我们作为一个班一起做Anki一样。这并不会使SRS比其他所有他们不会做的事情（比如它所取代的事情）更糟糕，但也不会使它更好。我有很好的理由从全班模式开始，而不是1:1模式，这些理由并没有消失。但是**我不认为如果没有1:1的学习者应用程序交互，SRS能够显著改善冷漠学习者的学习效果**。我可不想一直把那些孩子们给打发走。

Because brains in neutral *can* still learn. They just can't do it on *purpose*.

因为中立的大脑仍然可以学习。他们不能故意这么做。

I credit my relative success with lower-tier teens over the years to my pragmatism about this. I try to keep things breezy, sweeping the students along in a gentle flow that washes them through the [Zone of Proximal Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development) and out the other side with a few bits of knowledge surreptitiously clinging to them.

我把这些年来在低层青少年中取得的相对成功归功于我在这方面的实用主义。我试着让事情变得轻松愉快，以一种温和的方式把学生们带到[最近发展区](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development)在另一边偷偷地掌握着一些知识。

I said last year that easy cards are important. I also talked about the value of a vivid narrative or experience as a hook for new content. Let me go a step farther now and assert that **a good card for an apathetic learner will feel unneeded on creation**, because it's only a baby step away from what they already knew and because you pounded it home by way of a narrative so gripping that even the laziest brain couldn't help following it to its conclusion. A card for this will smell like overkill. Hold your nose and make it anyway.

我去年说过简单的卡片很重要。我还谈到了一个生动的故事或经验作为新内容的价值。现在让我更进一步，断言**对于一个冷漠的学习者来说，一张好的卡片在创造时会觉得没有必要**，因为它离他们已经知道的东西只有一小步之遥，而且因为你用一种扣人心弦的叙述方式把它敲回家，即使是最懒惰的大脑也忍不住跟着它走到最后。这张牌闻起来像是杀戮过度。不管怎样，都要捏住鼻子。

Everyone will get such a card right on the very first try, but that doesn't make it unnecessary. A vivid implanted memory will replay and refresh itself readily, but only if something prompts it. So it still needs a rehearsal schedule.

每个人在第一次尝试时都会得到这样一张卡片，但这并不意味着没有必要。一个生动的植入记忆将很容易重放和刷新自己，但只有在有什么提示它。所以还需要排练日程。

Neglected, it is the fate of all things to be claimed by the Whore of Babble-On and cast into Outer Wherever with a flash of her indolent [smize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolPTBw6M9M).

### Abort, retry, fail?

### 中止、重试、失败？

One of my goals from last year was to be more conservative when setting the next reviews of cards. This worked well enough at the start of the year when the decks were relatively small. By second semester, however, we had outrun our tail again, just like last year. Considering that I didn't reduce the number of cards or increase the length of our study sessions, this was inevitable. For every card I kept in higher circulation there was another card languishing unstudied. **If you don't keep up with your reviews, the effective size of your deck will always be smaller than its actual size**.

我去年的一个目标是，在制定下一次信用卡审查时更加保守。这在今年年初牌组相对较小的时候已经足够有效了。然而，到了第二学期，我们又像去年一样跑了出来。考虑到我没有减少卡片的数量或增加学习时间，这是不可避免的。每一张我保存在更高流通量的卡片都有另一张未经研究的卡片**如果你不跟上你的评论，你的牌堆的有效大小将总是小于它的实际大小。

Where I never thinned my deck, the thermodynamics of Anki did it for me. Cool? To the degree that I chose higher-priority cards wisely, this worked out fine. But it added an additional wrinkle to cards on the margins.

在我从未减薄我的牌组的地方，Anki的热力学为我做到了。酷吗？在某种程度上，我明智地选择了更高优先级的卡，这很好。但这给卡片的边缘增加了一道皱纹。

See, due to the way Anki works, when you review a card that is long overdue, if you don't press the red button to re-learn it completely, your only other feedback options set the next review far in the future. I understand the logic: If you didn't know the answer, then why *wouldn't* you reset it? And if you *did* know the answer, then it clearly didn't matter that the interval was so long, so why not set the next one even longer?

你看，由于Anki的工作方式，当你回顾一张早就过期的卡片时，如果你不按红色按钮完全重新学习它，你唯一的其他反馈选项将把下一次的回顾设定在遥远的将来。我理解这个逻辑：如果你不知道答案，那你为什么不重置它？如果你真的知道答案，那么间隔这么长显然无关紧要，为什么不把下一个间隔再长一点呢？

However, these are not great options when sharing a single instance of a deck with a roomful of students. These are also poor options if you're trying to sustain a higher level of automaticity with that card (see the Tiers of Availability section above). Should I press the red button and make it one of the Chosen again—dooming some other card to oblivion if our reviews don't get any longer—or should I press the next button over and kick this card so far back out that *it* might as well be dead?

然而，当与一屋子的学生共享一个牌组实例时，这些并不是很好的选择。如果您试图用该卡保持更高级别的自动化，那么这些选项也很糟糕（请参阅上面的可用性层次部分）。我是不是应该按下红色的按钮，让它再次成为被选中的一张卡片，如果我们的评论再也看不下去的话，它就会被其他卡片遗忘，还是应该按下下一个按钮，把这张卡片踢得太远，让它像死了一样？

Even in the case of my personal learning, I think there is room in an SRS for buttons that reduce the next interval on a card without resetting it all the way back to zero.

即使是在我个人学习的情况下，我认为SRS中也有空间容纳按钮，这些按钮可以减少卡片上的下一个间隔，而不会一直重置为零。

### Red button repulsion

### 红按钮排斥

I had made it an explicit goal to reset a card when it was clear we had lost our grip on it. But even when I wasn't worried about time constraints, I still found it very difficult to press that red button. I think this was mostly self-consciousness. Pressing that button means putting the card back in an initial learning mode where, unless you cut the session short, it will come up multiple times again that day. This is by design, of course. But at the front of a classroom, it *feels* wrong. I blame two factors:

我明确的目标是重新设置一张牌，因为很明显我们已经失去了对它的控制。但即使我不担心时间的限制，我还是发现很难按下那个红色按钮。我认为这主要是自我意识。按下该按钮意味着将卡片放回初始学习模式，除非你缩短课程，否则当天它会出现多次。当然，这是故意的。但在教室前面，感觉是不对的。我归咎于两个因素：

1) “Vivid memory, card ready” means we get most new cards right on the first try, so a repeated card feels broken by comparison.

1） “生动的记忆，卡片准备好”意味着我们在第一次尝试时就获得了大多数新卡片，因此一张重复的卡片在比较中感觉很糟糕。

2) I feel like I'm playing the part of an 18th century schoolmaster leading a class in chants at ruler-point. “Drill and kill” is a catchy phrase today's teachers hear in their heads whenever they use rote learning, because we've been heavily conditioned via our training and Hollywood that this is what Bad Teaching looks like.

2） 我觉得自己在扮演一个18世纪的校长的角色，带领一个班级在“统治者点”唱圣歌“钻和杀”是一个流行的短语，今天的老师听到他们的头脑，每当他们使用死记硬背的学习，因为我们已经通过我们的培训和好莱坞，这是什么样的坏教学严重条件。

This might be one of the greatest overcorrections in the history of education. I'm not saying we should use unadorned repetition as our tool of first resort, but learning and remembering do not happen without some sort of reiteration going on, and we've made it taboo to use the most direct approach to it. We're like soldiers in a gunfight who have decided we should only kill via ricochets.

这可能是教育史上最大的矫枉过正之一。我并不是说我们应该使用简单的重复作为我们的首选工具，但是学习和记忆不会在没有某种重复的情况下发生，而且我们已经禁止使用最直接的方法。我们就像枪战中的士兵，他们决定我们只能通过跳弹杀人。

It looks deathly boring to an observer, but, **in moderation, most students actually enjoy traditional rote learning**. They enjoy the confidence that they will for sure get the information into their head before moving on. They enjoy the validation they get with each chance to confirm that they remember something. They enjoy going with the flow of a whole class doing the same thing.[^7]They enjoy the respite of learning on rails for a change, without any expectation that they take initiative or parse instructions.

对一个观察者来说，这看起来非常无聊，但是，**适度地说，大多数学生实际上喜欢传统的死记硬背学习**。他们很有信心，在继续前进之前，他们一定会把这些信息记在脑子里。他们享受每一次确认自己记得什么的机会所带来的验证。他们喜欢跟着全班同学做同样的事情。他们享受在rails上学习的喘息时间，而不期望自己主动或解析指令。

So, when I do work up the courage to press that red button, it's not uncommon for me to see students perk up and show additional interest even as I'm feeling embarrassed and fighting off an icky sensation in my gut.

所以，当我鼓起勇气按下那个红色按钮的时候，我经常看到学生们振作起来，表现出额外的兴趣，即使我感到尴尬，并在我的肠子里抵抗一种恶心的感觉。

Fight it I do, though. For one content type—Greek/Latin word fragments—I've actually switched to using Anki as our first exposure learning tool. It's a natural fit, and far more time efficient than the softer introductions I've used in the past. Adding 6-10 new word fragments a day builds a solid repertoire in just a couple weeks, and each day's learning builds to a rewarding climax as they go from timid to confident with the newest cards.

尽管如此，我还是要反抗。对于一个内容类型希腊语/拉丁语单词片段，我实际上已经改用Anki作为我们的第一个曝光学习工具。这是一种自然的契合，而且比我过去使用的更柔和的介绍更节省时间。每天添加6-10个新单词片段可以在短短的几周内形成一个稳定的曲目，每天的学习也会随着他们对最新卡片从怯懦到自信而达到一个有益的高潮。

I propose a new catch-phrase: **Drill and instill**.

我提出了一个新的口号：*训练和灌输**。

### So say we all

### 我们都这么说

The stats say I went faster with the cards this year. This was deliberate. Our total number of reviews did not rise, however, as our study sessions tended to be a bit shorter. This was *not*deliberate, but more a reflection of engagement tending to peter out sooner. It remains my policy to stop reviews before they feel too much like drudgery.

数据显示今年我的牌打得更快。这是故意的。然而，我们的总评论数量并没有增加，因为我们的学习时间往往要短一点。这并不是故意的，但更多地反映了订婚倾向于提前结束。我的政策仍然是，在审查变得太枯燥之前停止审查。

![Description here.](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cylKbjGlw_Q/VyZ3vmmaTgI/AAAAAAAAJZI/IJRETos1LqMCtjL-75czzjsO2NGXL2IHwCK4B/s1600/SRSYear2.PNG)

[Two years of data for one class period, accidentally merged together (I hadn't realized Anki would remember the history of deleted decks).]

[一节课的两年数据，意外地合并在一起（我没有意识到Anki会记得被删除的牌组的历史）。]

Most of the time savings came from stopping the use of our colored feedback cards. By December, nearly every student had stopped holding up any color other than green, perhaps tiring of the small inconvenience of considering their personal relationship with a card and rotating it to the appropriate color. Once I felt like the quality of information I was getting from them was too low to justify those few seconds I spent soliciting the feedback on each card, I stopped asking for it.

大部分时间的节省来自停止使用我们的彩色反馈卡。到了12月，几乎每个学生都不再举绿色以外的任何颜色了，也许是厌倦了考虑他们与卡片的个人关系并将其旋转成合适的颜色这一小小的不便。一旦我觉得我从他们那里得到的信息质量太低，不足以证明我花了几秒钟征求每张卡片上的反馈，我就不再要求了。

This may have been a mistake.

这可能是个错误。

I felt like engagement levels dropped off a bit after the switch and never recovered. I don't think it had to do with feeling de-voiced, since hardly anyone was still giving actual feedback via the cards. But I think **the cards might have served as a participation priming device**, keeping students in the Anki mindset by giving them a way to say “Amen”.

我觉得在切换之后，参与度下降了一点，再也没有恢复过来。我不认为这是因为感觉没有声音，因为几乎没有人仍然通过卡片给出实际的反馈。但我认为**卡片可能是一种参与启动装置**，通过给学生一种说“阿门”的方式，让他们保持Anki的心态。

### The calendar is a harsh(er) mistress

### 日历是个苛刻的女主人

Last year, I bemoaned the difficulty of keeping up with an SRS regimen when not every day is a school day. Well, our calendar changed this year. We now take a shorter summer in exchange for longer breaks in the fall and spring. Pause and predict the consequences! You will very likely be correct.

去年，我哀叹在不是每天都是上学日的情况下，很难跟上SRS养生法。嗯，今年我们的日历变了。我们现在用更短的夏天来换取秋天和春天更长的休息时间。暂停并预测后果！你很可能是对的。

Ready?

准备好了吗？

We were able to recover from two weeks off in the fall readily enough, but just as we were about to catch up from the winter holidays were were beset upon by an equally lengthy spring break. Right on its heels was a short holiday week that was itself hounded by three full weeks of a special block-period testing schedule that saw each class meeting only three times a week.

我们能够很快地从秋天的两个星期休假中恢复过来，但就在我们即将赶上寒假的时候，却被同样漫长的春假所困扰。紧随其后的是一个短暂的假期周，它本身就被整整三周的一个特殊的分组考试时间表所困扰，每个班级每周只开三次会议。

And so it was we went into the state test with our Anki freshness at an all-time low.

因此，我们进入了国家测试与我们的 Anki 新鲜度在历史最低水平。

I'm still pretty down on the odds of getting anyone to study an SRS on weekends and days off, but the state of our calendar insists that I revisit the notion.

我仍然很难让任何人在周末和休息日学习SRS，但我们的日历状态坚持让我重新考虑这个概念。

### Nature, nurture

### 先天，后天

A modest number of students from last year had me again this year. It was my goal to keep an eye on them. Would they be supercharged? Would they regress to the mean?

去年的一些学生今年又遇到了我。我的目标是密切关注他们。他们会不会超常发挥？他们会不会退步到平均值？

A bit of both. Some of my mediocre repeats seemed much more confident, but I'm used to seeing that with second-years even without SRS. Anki gave them a way to demonstrate their retention, though, as some of my boilerplate cards are the same for both of my grade levels. They enjoyed having a strong grip on these from the get-go, and occasionally surprised me by recalling something obscure that was unique to last year's deck.

两者兼而有之。我的一些平庸的重复似乎更有信心，但我习惯于看到第二年即使没有SRS。不过，Anki给了他们一个证明自己保留的方法，因为我的一些样板卡对我的两个年级都是一样的。他们喜欢从一开始就牢牢抓住这些东西，偶尔也会让我惊讶地回忆起去年那组独特的晦涩难懂的东西。

Low performers were still low performers.

表现不佳者仍然表现不佳。

But among my high-achieving returners there were some surprising contrasts. Most of them started strong and have generally just coasted along on a plateau of awesome. Two of my all-stars, however, started the year weirdly inept, bombing pretests as though last year had never happened.

但在我那些成就斐然的归国者中，有一些惊人的反差。他们中的大多数人一开始都很强壮，通常只是在一个令人敬畏的高原上滑行。然而，我的两位全明星在今年的开局却出奇地无能，轰炸预考，好像去年从未发生过一样。

These cases can be terribly disheartening. If I didn't already believe the research about the mostly fixed-at-birth nature of intelligence, these seemingly leaky brains would certainly have pushed me in that direction. But this is actually a strong argument for SRS. Regular participation in class Anki seems to have steadily pumped at least some students with lower-than-I-had-appreciated innate ability to a much higher *functioning* level of performance.

这些案件可能令人非常沮丧。如果我还不相信关于智力本质的研究，那么这些貌似漏洞百出的大脑肯定会把我推向那个方向。但这实际上是SRS的一个有力论据。定期参加 Anki 班似乎已经稳定地把一些天生能力比我低的学生提升到了更高的表现水平。

The two students in question eventually resumed outperforming most of their peers, but it took a while. And here we see a strong argument for the narrower idea of trying to sell students with any motivation on the life-changing potential of an *independent,* *year-round*SRS habit.

这两名学生最终恢复了表现，超过了大多数同龄人，但这需要一段时间。在这里，我们看到了一个强有力的论据，支持狭义的观点，即试图向学生推销一种“独立的，**全年的”SRS习惯改变生活的潜力。

### A life changed

### 生活改变了

It *can* happen. My wife had spent some time using Anki with her high school Spanish students last year, in tandem with my own experiments. (She has since switched to Duolingo for very good reasons, but with all of the difficulties inherent to getting students to use apps independently).

这*能*发生。我的妻子去年花了一些时间对她的高中西班牙语学生使用 Anki，与我自己的实验同步进行。（她后来转而使用Duolingo，理由非常充分，但要让学生独立使用应用程序有很多固有的困难）。

She describes one of her students from last year as a slow-but-motivated learner who really struggled in all of her classes. But she found Anki powerful enough that she started making cards on her own for her other classes. It was the lifeline she hadn't known she needed. Her confidence and performance climbed steadily, and she is now said to be in the running for valedictorian.

她把去年的一个学生描述成一个缓慢但积极的学习者，在她所有的课上都很努力。但她发现 Anki 足够强大，于是她开始自己为其他班级制作卡片。这是她不知道自己需要的生命线。她的信心和表现稳步攀升，据说她现在正在竞选告别演说。

The moral of the story is that **the low hanging fruit of SRS is awareness**, because there is a tiny fraction of the student population who will latch onto it and reap epic benefits—students who have this enormous pent-up charge potential and are [grasping blindly for a conduit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MUYsIjTKvk&ab_channel=Storm&t=44s). So if you do nothing else, at least get the word out.

这个故事的寓意是，**SRS 的低垂果实是意识**，因为有一小部分学生会抓住它并获得史诗般的好处——学生们有这种巨大的压抑的电荷潜力，并且[盲目地抓着一个管道](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MUYsIjTKvk&ab_channel=Storm&t=44s)。因此，如果你什么都不做，至少要把这个消息传出去。

But that's just one student—not even mine—out of hundreds now. And she might have found some other way to succeed. So how big of a deal is this?

但那只是几百个学生中的一个，甚至不是我的。她可能找到了其他成功的方法。那么这有多重要呢？

That's hard to say, mostly because we rarely find out what students do with their lives after they've had us. For all I know, **there could be a bunch of sleeper agents among my alumni**—students who will remember SRS when they reach a point in their life where they finally have the level of focus and motivation needed to make use of it. This doesn't seem too far-fetched, judging from the often dramatic change in students I see from one year to the next if they have me again, and from memories of my own low motivation at that age.

这很难说，主要是因为我们很少发现学生在接受了我们的教育之后，他们的生活会怎样。据我所知，**我的校友中可能有一群熟睡的经纪人**——当他们到达人生的某一阶段，终于有了利用 SRS 所需的专注度和动力时，他们会记得 SRS。这似乎并不太牵强，从我看到的学生从一年到下一年的戏剧性变化来看，如果他们再遇到我，以及从我自己在那个年龄段的低动力的记忆来看。

### Conclusion

### 结论

While I've continued to learn from my experiences with classroom SRS, I think we actually got less value from it than we did last year. I'm not content with this. While I could simply blame this on the way I've prioritized my personal growth over course improvement, this would be missing the point, because a classroom SRS system that only a driven tech-savvy veteran in a good mood can make work is not nearly good enough.

虽然我继续从课堂 SRS 的经验中学习，但我认为我们从中得到的价值实际上比去年要少。我对此并不满意。虽然我可以简单地将此归咎于我将个人成长置于课程改进之上的方式，但这将错过重点，因为一个只有在心情好的情况下被驱动的精通技术的老手才能使课堂 SRS 系统发挥作用，这远远不够。

I persist because I know spaced repetition, at its fiery molten core, *works*, and I want to find an approach that will work for other teachers, other classrooms, other students. I don't think that approach will look very much like what I'm doing now.

我之所以坚持，是因为我知道间隔性重复，在其火热的熔体核心，是*有效的*，我想找到一种对其他老师、其他教室、其他学生都有效的方法。我不认为这种方法会像我现在做的一样。

The good news is that months of [hammock-driven development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) and tech skill-ups have not been wasted. I don't just have goal to make classroom SRS work now.

好消息是，几个月的[吊床驱动开发](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)和技术技能的提高没有被浪费掉。我现在的目标不仅仅是让教室 SRS 发挥作用。

I have a **vision**.

我有个**愿景**。

## 注意事项

[^1]: John Cleese, of Monty Python fame, has some interesting advice about what he calls "open mode" and "closed mode", and how to use them, though the actual video address linked in [this article](https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/04/12/john-cleese-on-creativity-1991/) is no longer posted.

[^2]:Is a student able to read for fun during your class, dear teacher? If not, you'd better be have some *damned* good content. Pleasure reading is [strongly correlated](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/ToRead.pdf) with improved learning and life outcomes—much more strongly than *you* are, I'll wager. 亲爱的老师，在你的课堂上，一个学生能以阅读为乐趣吗？如果没有，你最好有一些该死的好内容。快乐阅读是[密切相关的](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/ToRead.pdf)我敢打赌，随着学习和生活成果的改善，你的表现会比你强得多。
[^3]:That “2nd system” I built for collecting, computing, and communicating a huge range of classroom metrics has become my periphery brain. It’s the thing teachers and administrators actually come to me about. It’s also crafted entirely out of noodly Excel VBA by someone who was thinking only of himself; someone who hard-coded almost everything at the function level—whose idea of input validation was “I’ll just never send it that”; and whose idea of accessibility was undocumented hotkeys that favor Dvorak on the left hand. In other words, it's utterly unsharable. I could write a friendlier version, but it would be a pretty epic project that hardly anyone would actually use, simply because of different teaching styles. If I'm going to build a system to share, it's going to be System 3... the future system now haunting my dreams. 我为收集、计算和交流大量课堂指标而建立的“第二个系统”已经成为我的外围大脑。这是老师和管理人员真正来找我的原因。它也完全是由一个只考虑自己的人用粗糙的excelvba制作的；一个在函数级硬编码几乎所有内容的人，其输入验证的想法是“我永远不会那样发送”；他们的无障碍性概念是支持左手德沃夏克的无文档热键。换句话说，这是完全不可改变的。我可以写一个更友好的版本，但这将是一个相当史诗般的项目，几乎没有人会真正使用，只是因为不同的教学风格。如果我要建立一个共享的系统，那就是系统3。。。未来的系统现在萦绕在我的梦里。
[^4]:I actually told myself both sets of stories ahead of time to keep me honest when results day came around. ["If you are equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge."](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/) 事实上，当结果日到来的时候，我提前告诉了自己这两组故事，以保持我的诚实如果你同样擅长解释任何结果，你就没有任何知识
[^5]:Daniel Kahneman, in *[Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)*, summarizing conclusions from a study about the effect of mood on the ability to make connections between ideas: "When in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors." 丹尼尔·卡尼曼，在*[思考快与慢](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)*,总结了一项关于情绪对思想联系能力影响的研究得出的结论：“心情好的时候，人们会变得更直观、更有创造力，但也不那么警惕，更容易出现逻辑错误。”
[^6]:I don't actually write login credentials on my cards. I leave the answers blank and just rate them so conservatively with every study that I never have a chance to forget them. 我不会在我的卡上写登录凭证。我把答案留空，只是在每一项研究中对它们进行保守的评价，我从来没有机会忘记它们。
[^7]:I once had the privilege of observing part of a lesson in a traditional [Mennonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mennonites_in_Mexico) one-room schoolhouse. I don't speak a word of Low German, but it was clear the kids knew whatever it was they were drilling as they stood up and recited together. Most striking was the fact that they were *all* on the same page. There were no stragglers spacing out, slumped over, dozing off. The teacher could confidently build up to whatever came next without fear of leaving anyone behind. 我曾经有幸在一个传统的[门诺派](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mennonites_in_Mexico)中观察了一节课的一部分一间教室。我不会说一句低沉的德语，但很明显，孩子们站起来一起背诵时知道他们在练习什么。最引人注目的是他们都在同一页上。没有一个掉队的人站在外面，瘫倒在地，打瞌睡。老师可以自信地为接下来发生的事情而努力，而不必担心丢下任何人。
