# Teacher 老师

原文：https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Teacher

## Definition 定义

**Teacher** is a partially interactive provider of knowledge for students.

**老师**是为学生提供知识的部分互动提供者。

## Exclusions 例外

Throughout [SuperMemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru), the teacher is primarily understood as a schoolteacher, i.e. an employee of the school systems. For private one-on-one teachers, I try to stick to the term **tutor**. Educators, mentors, gurus and role models do not qualify either unless they are school teachers at the same time.

在整个 SuperMemo Guru 中，老师主要被理解为学校老师，即学校系统的雇员。对于一对一的私人老师，我尽量坚持使用**导师**一词。教育家、师傅、大师和榜样也不符合条件，除非他们同时也是学校老师。

I exclude parents from the definition of the teacher even though they are often considered most important teachers. I am not a teacher either. What I provide at [SuperMemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru) are just my thoughts that students and adults can consume voluntarily.

我把父母排除在老师的定义之外，尽管他们经常被认为是最重要的老师。我也不是一个老师。我在 SuperMemo Guru 提供的只是我的想法，学生和成年人可以自愿摄取。

## Teachers are great 老师是伟大的

**All teachers I know are lovely people**. All teachers I talk to regularly are highly intelligent and deeply concerned about the well-being of their students. This does not mean that all teachers are great. I often meet teachers who just refuse to talk. When they know that I am a *"man with an agenda"* (i.e. I write texts that denounce [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling)), they may be doubly reluctant. In that excluded set of mute teachers, there must be some bad apples. After all, I also talk to kids, and they nearly always can point to some awful teachers doing some awful things. I also had an [awful teacher](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/My_worst_teacher) that years later turned out to be a lovely lady.

**我认识的所有老师都是可爱的人**。我经常与之交谈的所有老师都非常聪明，并对学生的福祉深感关切。这并不意味着所有的老师都是伟大的。我经常遇到那些拒绝交谈的老师。当他们知道我是一个 "有目的的人"（即我写文章谴责义务教育），他们可能会加倍不愿意。在那批被排除在外的哑巴老师中，一定有一些害群之马。毕竟，我也和孩子们谈过，他们几乎都能指出一些可怕的老师做了一些可怕的事情。我也有一个可怕的老师，多年后变成了一位可爱的女士。

## Bad apples 害群之马

Kids are often wrong when judging their teachers. They can see only one side of the picture. However, when children are unhappy at school, we always need to look for some change. Great teachers also need to change if they contribute to that unhappiness. Sadly, more often than not, they cannot change because they are part of a coercive system. Their job and pay often depend on [doing things that harm children](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto:_I_refuse_to_hurt_children).

孩子们在评判他们的老师时往往是错误的。他们只能看到事情的一面。然而，当孩子们在学校不开心的时候，我们总是需要寻找一些改变。优秀的老师也需要改变，如果他们促成了这种不快乐。可悲的是，更多的时候，他们无法改变，因为他们是一个强制系统的一部分。他们的工作和报酬往往取决于做伤害儿童的事情。

> Kids are often wrong. I know it all too well because I met the teacher who I nominated for the title of the *"worst teachers in my life"*. Twelve years after my last class, she turned out to be a charming lady, who happened to remember me as her *"worst student"*. How come, two mortal enemies meet, drink coffee, and have a great chat about schooling? I blame [the system](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Prussian_education_system). When a teacher with a disciplinarian mindset meets a rebellious kid, things often go wrong. [Compulsory schooling must end](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end).

> 孩子们往往是错误的。我对此深有体会，因为我遇到了被我提名为 "我一生中最糟糕的老师 "的老师。在我上完最后一堂课的 12 年后，她变成了一位迷人的女士，恰好记得我是她的 "最差学生"。怎么会这样，两个死对头见面，喝着咖啡，大谈特谈学校教育？我怪罪于这个系统。当一个有纪律观念的老师遇到一个叛逆的孩子，事情往往会出错。义务教育必须结束。更多信息请见：我最差的老师
