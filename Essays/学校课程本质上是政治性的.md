# School curriculum is inherently political 学校课程本质上是政治性的

## Political curriculum

## 政治性的课程

The prevalent model of an ideal industrial nation state includes a system of education that is based on compulsory [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum). Compulsory curriculum is a violation of human rights, and a violation of the [freedom of education](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/On_freedom_of_education_and_freedom_of_information). The power of the curriculum to influence the minds is often mentioned in efforts to enact a [ban on homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling). See: [Compulsory schooling must end](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end)

理想的工业民族国家的普遍模式包括以义务课程为基础的教育制度。义务课程是对人权的侵犯，也是对教育自由的侵犯。在颁布家庭教育禁令的努力中，课程影响思想的力量经常被提及。见：义务教育必须停止

### Duplication of great minds

### 伟大思想的复制品

A few years ago, when I wrote that *"politicians battle hard for the influence over young brains"* (in this text: [*"Learning history"*](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)), someone called me a "populist" who supposedly contrasts his good cause with *"bad politicians"*. This indicates that some people in this world do not see that the [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum) is a subject of never-ending ideological battles around the planet. Stalin observed correctly: *"Education is a weapon, whose effect depends on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed"*. Hitler demanded compulsory education that would make each young boy or girl *"conscious of his **race** and a member of the **folk-community** ([Volksgemeinschaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksgemeinschaft))"*. Finally, Lenin noticed: "*Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted*".

几年前，当我写下 "政客们为影响年轻人的大脑而努力战斗 "时（见此文：《学习历史》），有人骂我是 "民粹主义者"，据说他把自己的好事业与 "坏政客 "对立起来。这说明这个世界上有些人没有看到，课程是地球上永无休止的意识形态之争的主题。斯大林的观察是正确的。"教育是一种武器，它的效果取决于谁拿着它，对准谁"。希特勒要求实行义务教育，使每个男孩或女孩 "意识到自己的种族和民间社会的成员"。最后，列宁注意到了。"给我四年时间来教育孩子们，我播下的种子就永远不会被连根拔起"。

It is true that early learning makes a strong imprint on the entire spectrum of a person's knowledge. This fact can be derived from the [neurostatistical model of memory](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neurostatistical_model_of_memory), in particular, the [two component model of memory stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_component_model_of_memory_stability). Things we learn in childhood can often become literally etched in the brain architecture by shaping neural maps that route information in the cortex. However, Lenin was wrong on at least two counts:

诚然，早期的学习会在一个人的整个知识谱系中留下浓重的印记。这个事实可以从记忆的神经统计学模型，特别是记忆稳定性的双成分模型中得出。我们在童年所学到的东西，往往可以通过塑造大脑皮层中信息路线的神经地图，成为字面上的刻痕。然而，列宁至少有两点是错的：

- early learning can be unlearned (even though in can be hard indeed)
- 早期的学习是可以被遗忘的（即使过程确实很困难）
- four years of teaching is a very weak indoctrination tool
- 四年的教学是一个非常薄弱的灌输工具

Whatever made some sense in the 1920s, does not work at all in the modern world. In today's society, kids know everything from the web, and if their access is limited (e.g. by authoritarian parents), they know everything from friends who know everything from the web.

在20世纪20年代有一定意义的东西，在现代社会根本行不通。在当今社会，孩子们从网络上知道一切，如果他们的访问受到限制（比如被专制的父母限制），他们从朋友那里知道一切，而朋友又从网络上知道一切。

### Communication vs. indoctrination

### 沟通与灌输

All healthy people attempt to influence the minds of others. This is the purpose of communication. I try to influence your mind with this text too. [Advanced English](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_English) has a great deal of pictures of Tesla and not a single one of Volkswagen. The [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum) is an indoctrination tool as well. After all it has its origins in catechism, which means it is no less than two millennia old.

所有健康的人都试图影响他人的思想。这就是沟通的目的。我也试图用这篇文字影响你的心灵。《高级英语》中有大量的特斯拉的图片，却没有一张大众汽车的图片。课程也是一种灌输工具。毕竟它起源于慕课，也就是说它的历史不低于两千年。

Most of all, compulsory [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum) is a violation of human rights. My words in this text are an expression of free speech that may convince nobody. Coercive indoctrination by means of the [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum) in [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) is nothing else than a form of intellectual slavery. Even simple facts of science should not be hammered in coercively. It is not just they do not work. Homogenization of knowledge is harmful. Today we may learn about the heliocentric system, but the compulsory curriculum of 500 years ago would certainly include the Ptolemaic model. In the same vein, we may be locking young minds into the inertia of non-exploration that undermines collective intelligence and may one day spell doom for mankind.

最重要的是，义务教育课程是对人权的侵犯。我在这篇文字里的话，是自由言论的表达，可能谁也说服不了谁。义务教育中以课程的方式进行强制灌输，无非是一种知识奴役。即使是简单的科学事实，也不应该强行敲打。这不仅仅是它们没有用。知识的同质化是有害的。今天，我们可以学习日心说，但500年前的义务教育课程肯定会包括托勒密模式。同样，我们可能会把年轻人的思想锁定在不探索的惯性中，破坏集体智慧，也许有一天会给人类带来灭顶之灾。

### My own indoctrination

### 我自己的教化

My own life delivered a funny twist on the failures of indoctrination. As a kid, I was wedged between the communist curriculum at school, and the Catholic indoctrination at church. Obviously, the two vectors cancel each other, but it would not matter in my case. I just did not pay attention. Schools don't work. They are pathetically weak as indoctrination devices. In my DIY class, I fashioned a wooden tray in which big letters had been etched with hot iron: **"Glory to the communist party"**. My mom was proud. She loved the tray and used it for many years. Nobody ever seemed to pay any attention to the silly slogan. At the same time, sermons at church were even more boring than classes at school. There was always more tolerance to chatting and fidgeting at school. That makes [boredom](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Boredom) at school more tolerable. Which indoctrination prevailed in my mind? Neither. I read a book about biological evolution and it was far more captivating than all the claptrap seeping from the adult world. I quit the church at the age of 10. As for communist ideology, it left some seeds to this day. I still like to contribute to the community. Some of that is natural and instinctive, some comes from a rational realization that my little contributions pay back handsomely in contributions from others. I love Wikipedia, which is an embodiment of that ideal. I was raised to be a patriot, but then [I stopped being patriotic](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_stopped_being_patriotic). All that communist indoctrination efforts at school failed to work and often backfired. To this day I did not recover from negative feelings I have for Polish literature classics (see: [Why I do not read fiction](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_I_do_not_read_fiction)). **[Compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) is like compulsory chocolate eating: it can make you sick of the best thing in the world**

我自己的生活给教化的失败带来了有趣的转折。小时候，我被夹在学校的共产主义课程和教堂的天主教灌输之间。很明显，这两个向度是互相抵消的，但在我的情况下，这并不重要。我只是没有注意。学校不起作用。它们作为灌输装置，弱得可怜。在我的DIY课上，我做了一个木盘，里面的大字是用热铁刻上去的。"共产党的光荣"。我妈妈很自豪。她很喜欢这个盘子，用了很多年。似乎从来没有人注意过这个愚蠢的口号。同时，教堂里的布道甚至比学校里的上课还要无聊。在学校里，人们对聊天和发呆总是比较宽容。这样一来，学校里的无聊就更能容忍了。在我的心目中，哪一种教化占了上风？都不是。我读过一本关于生物进化论的书，它远比成人世界里渗入的那些哗众取宠的东西更吸引人。我在10岁的时候就退出了教会。至于共产主义思想，至今还留下了一些种子。我还是喜欢为社会做贡献。有些是自然的、本能的，有些则是来自于理性的认识，我的小小贡献会从别人的贡献中得到丰厚的回报。我爱维基百科，它是这种理想的体现。我从小就是一个爱国者，但后来我不再爱国了。在学校里的那些共产主义灌输努力都没有成功，而且常常适得其反。直到今天，我还没有从对波兰文学经典的负面感情中恢复过来（见：我为什么不读小说）。义务教育就像义务吃巧克力一样：它能让你对世界上最好的东西产生厌恶感

## Indoctrination pendulum

## 灌输钟摆

I devoted a whole chapter to *"indoctrination via curriculum"* in [Ban on homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling#Indoctrination). In there I show how religions thrive under fire and how religious indoctrination and the atheist curriculum work to fossilize their respective proponents into hermitically closed opposing camps. **Fundamentalists thrive in conditions of repression, and fade in conditions of freedom**.

我在《禁止家庭教育》一书中用了整整一章来讨论 "通过课程进行灌输"。在那里，我展示了宗教是如何在炮火中茁壮成长的，以及宗教灌输和无神论者的课程是如何将各自的支持者化石为隐秘封闭的对立阵营的。原教旨主义者在压制的条件下茁壮成长，在自由的条件下消逝。

The main idea is that all forms of ideological indoctrination tend to backfire in the long term. They simply activate natural resistance implemented in the exploratory learning algorithm in the brain (see: [Education counteracts evolution](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Education_counteracts_evolution)). It is that resistance to indoctrination that underlies the forces of ideological pendulum, and, on a larger scale, the pendulum of history.

主要观点是，所有形式的意识形态灌输从长远来看往往会适得其反。它们只是激活了大脑中探索性学习算法中实施的自然抵抗（见：教育反作用于进化）。正是这种对灌输的抵抗，才是意识形态钟摆力量的基础，在更大范围内，也是历史钟摆的基础。

These are all natural oscillation that occur in the cultural battle of the memes. There is some value to those oscillations, and there are teaching moments in those extreme contrasts. For example, we learned a lot when Trump followed Obama (see: [Mystery of Donald Trump's brain](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mystery_of_Donald_Trump's_brain)). We will also learn a lot when Trump is ousted by a liberal of possibly far left variety.

这些都是在记忆的文化之争中发生的自然振荡。这些振荡是有一定价值的，在这些极端的对比中，也有教学的时刻。例如，当特朗普追随奥巴马时，我们学到了很多东西（见：唐纳德-特朗普大脑之谜）。当特朗普被一个可能是极左的自由主义者赶下台时，我们也会学到很多东西。

However, localized oscillations have the same value and result in less turmoil and social distress. Passions improve learning, but fierce battles may be inhibitory and distortive. This is why homogenization of knowledge via a common core curriculum is harmful. A healthy society is a diverse society in which communication between individuals is nearly always inspirational.

然而，局部的振荡具有同样的价值，并导致较少的动荡和社会困扰。激情能提高学习效果，但激烈的争斗可能会产生抑制和扭曲作用。这就是为什么通过共同的核心课程来实现知识的同质化是有害的。一个健康的社会是一个多元化的社会，在这个社会中，个人之间的交流几乎总是鼓舞人心的。

**The historical law of creativity says that each oppressive force will meet an opposite and a greater creative force**.

创造力的历史规律说，每一种压迫性的力量都会遇到一种相反的、更大的创造性力量。

## China

## 中国

China is an interesting case study on the evolution of the curriculum. The country can boast of a tremendous cultural tradition built over five millennia. Education in China was nicely decentralized and relatively free until the communist changed this all on a dime. As of then, geopolitical forces and cultural revolutions produced waves of splintering indoctrination trends that keep evolving to this day. The stages of curricular reform are described in detail in [this text by professors Yunhuo Cui and Zhu Yan](https://journals.openedition.org/ries/3846). What follows is just a quick summary.

中国是课程演变的一个有趣的案例研究。这个国家可以夸耀自己拥有五千年的巨大文化传统。中国的教育是很好的分散和相对自由的，直到共产主义改变了这一切。从那时起，地缘政治力量和文化革命产生了一波又一波的分裂灌输趋势，一直发展到今天。崔云火、朱岩教授在文中详细介绍了课程改革的各个阶段。下面只是做一个简单的总结。

### Mainland

### 内地

In mainland China, we could see the transition from the Soviet model that de-emphasized humanities and social sciences, to the renaissance of 1958-1968 promoting *"socialist and agrarian education"*, to Cultural Revolution of 1966, and to the decentralization of curriculum in 1985 with more emphasis on vocational education, and less room for creative arts.

在中国大陆，我们可以看到，从苏联模式淡化人文社会科学，到1958-1968年提倡 "社会主义和农业教育 "的文艺复兴，再到1966年的文化大革命，以及1985年的课程下放，更加强调职业教育，创意艺术的空间越来越小。

Finally, in 1999, new reforms brought new fresh ideas such as learning how to learn, selective curriculum, focus on lifelong learning, [semantic learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Semantic_learning), and more. Perhaps the system will ultimately evolve towards [my own prescription](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform)?

终于在1999年，新的改革带来了新的新鲜理念，如学会如何学习、选择性课程、注重终身学习、语义学习等。也许这个体系最终会朝着我自己的药方发展？

Chinese education is not free from adopting bad practices from the west (e.g. early preschool education). Otherwise, China is an intellectual powerhouse. The brains are strong and prolific, and there are pretty many of them. For me, it is a happy yardstick to know that SuperMemo is pretty popular in China. That makes me optimistic. I only hope that the political system won't ruin that massive potential with some authoritative prikaz.

中国教育不免采用西方的不良做法（如学前早期教育）。否则，中国是一个智力强国。脑力强大，多产，而且数量相当多。对我来说，知道SuperMemo在中国相当流行是一个幸福的标尺。这让我很乐观。我只希望政治制度不会用一些权威的prikaz毁掉这种巨大的潜力。

### Hong Kong

### 香港

A typical life of a kid in Hong Kong is a sad illustration of what is wrong with modern education and upbringing.

一个典型的香港孩子的生活，可悲地说明了现代教育和教养的问题。

[PISA](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA) scores of Hong Kong teens are [stellar](http://factsmaps.com/pisa-worldwide-ranking-average-score-of-math-science-reading/). However, scoring high is a [risk factor](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Dangers_of_being_a_Straight_A_student) for mental health and not only. Learning is propped by [cram schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram_schools_in_Hong_Kong), by kids who are often nurtured by "[monster parents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_parents)", with "[stressless](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience)" and privileged upbringing that gave origin to the label: ["Hong Kong kid"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Kids_phenomenon).

香港青少年的PISA成绩是很优秀的。然而，分数高是心理健康的危险因素，不仅如此。学习被补习学校支撑，孩子们往往被 "怪兽父母 "培养，"无压力 "和特权的成长环境，让标签的起源。"香港仔 "的标签。

On top of a stressful and busy life in Hong Kong, China's interference with its political system added one more factor: battle for the [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum). The new curriculum called [Moral and national education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_and_National_Education_controversy) is clearly oriented towards communist and nationalist propaganda. It started a wave of protests, incl. those initiated by students themselves (see [picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scholarism_2012.jpg)).

在香港紧张忙碌的生活之外，中国对其政治制度的干预又增加了一个因素：课程之争。名为德育和国民教育的新课程，明显以共产主义和民族主义宣传为导向。它引发了一波抗议活动，包括由学生自己发起的抗议活动（见图）。

In 2017, Henry Kwok [described the new curriculum](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/10/15/can-hong-kongs-revived-chinese-history-curriculum-serve-cement-national-identity/) in words that ring familiar in many places around the world:

2017年，郭士纳用世界上许多地方耳熟能详的话语描述了新课程：

> The rationale is not pedagogical but patently political, i.e. to foster a **blindingly patriotic, triumphalist sense of Chinese identity**. Pupils and teachers need to identify themselves as Chinese and love their “motherland,” no matter what. […] It echoes Xi Jinping’s pathological desire to tighten control over all aspects of social life in China and wipe out dissidents […] By revitalising a curriculum with heavy prescriptions of political history, the government is turning on its head and actively pursuing an agenda of **politicised education** […] Children aren’t empty vessels to be filled with nationalistic myths and therefore identify themselves more as Chinese. It is time for the government to stop bullying our children with its pathetic fetish for **mind control**
>
> 
>
> 理由不是教学上的，而是明显的政治上的，即培养一种盲目的爱国主义、胜利主义的中国认同感。学生和教师无论如何都要认同自己是中国人，热爱自己的 "祖国"。[......]这呼应了习近平加强控制中国社会生活各方面、消灭异己的病态欲望[......]通过重启带有浓重政治历史处方的课程，政府正在颠倒黑白，积极推行政治化教育的议程[......]孩子们不是被民族主义神话填满的空容器，因此更认同自己是中国人。政府是时候停止用其可悲的精神控制癖好来欺负我们的孩子了。

### Taiwan

### 台湾

In the meantime, it is no surprise that Taiwanese curriculum evolved differently, esp. in the interpretation of the history of China. In the 1950s, children would learn: *"Save our mainland compatriots from the deepest water and hottest fire"*. Today, the new curriculum seeks to find a new balance in the era of globalization, but it cannot escape [political squabbles](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/08/11/2003698324):

同时，台湾课程的演变也不足为奇，尤其是在对中国历史的解读上。在上世纪50年代，孩子们会学。"拯救大陆同胞于水深火热之中" 今天，新课标试图在全球化时代寻找新的平衡点，但也逃不过政治上的争吵：

> The more a nation seeks to embody and to be represented by the cultural history of their nation, the more the international community will consider its culture “unique,” [...] **Taiwanese students should develop more confidence about their feelings for their country**. [...] If young people do not understand the greatness of their nation and the difficulty of its founding, it would be difficult for them to identify with the country and its history [..] If that were to happen, the Democratic Progressive Party would accomplish its **political goal of [desinicizing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/desinicization) Taiwan entirely**
>
> 
>
> 一个民族越是追求体现和代表本民族的文化历史，国际社会就越会认为它的文化是 "独特的"，[......]台湾学生应该对自己的国家感情产生更多的自信。[......]如果年轻人不了解自己国家的伟大和建国的艰难，就很难认同国家和历史[......]如果这样的话，民进党就会完成其将台湾完全除名的政治目标了

## USA

## 美国

Thousands of articles about the curriculum problem in the US are just a Google click away (I recommend [Alfie Kohn](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alfie_Kohn)'s blog site). It does not really matter who is right in that tug-of-war. In a diverse population there will be a diverse set of opinions. This is good. This is why a homogenous common core standard has to make everyone upset, esp. when it comes to topics such as evolution, climate change, civics, history, literature, religion, sexual education, and more.

只要在谷歌上点击一下，就能看到成千上万篇关于美国课程问题的文章（我推荐Alfie Kohn的博客网站）。在这场拉锯战中，谁是对的其实并不重要。在一个多元化的人群中，会有各种各样的意见。这是好的。这就是为什么同质化的共同核心标准要让大家不高兴的原因，尤其是涉及到进化论、气候变化、公民、历史、文学、宗教、性教育等话题的时候。

Here is just a random juxtaposition of angry backlash against indoctrination.

这里只是随机并列的对灌输的愤怒反击。

A conservative voice (Michelle Malkin):

一个保守派的声音（Michelle Malkin）：

> America’s downfall doesn’t begin with the “low-information voter.” It starts with the **no-knowledge student**. For decades, collectivist **agitators** in our schools have chipped away at academic excellence in the name of fairness, diversity and social justice. “Progressive” reformers denounced Western civilization requirements, the Founding Fathers and the Great Books as racist. They attacked traditional grammar classes as irrelevant in modern life. They deemed ability grouping of students (tracking) bad for self-esteem. They replaced time-tested rote techniques and standard algorithms with fuzzy math, inventive spelling and multicultural claptrap
>
> 
>
> 美国的垮台并不是从 "低信息选民 "开始的。它开始与无知识的学生。几十年来，我们学校里的集体主义煽动者以公平、多样性和社会正义的名义，削去了学术上的优秀表现。"进步 "的改革者谴责西方文明的要求，开国元勋和伟大的书籍是种族主义的。他们抨击传统的语法课在现代生活中无关紧要。他们认为对学生进行能力分组（追踪）对自尊心不利。他们用模糊的数学、创造性的拼写和多元文化的哗众取宠取代了久经考验的死记硬背技术和标准算法。

A liberal voice:

一个自由主义的声音：

> Common Core is the ideological stepchild of President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act: another high-stakes testing program imposed from Washington with big help from wealthy foundations and little help from teachers, parents and local communities. This is a set of standards that does not reflect the experience of many groups of students served by public education, does not reflect the concerns that many parents have for what they want to see in their education, and that really doubles down on a testing-and-punish regime that has proven to be the wrong approach to improving public education
>
> 
>
> 共同核心是布什总统的 "不让一个孩子掉队 "法案的意识形态继任者：另一个由华盛顿强加的高风险测试项目，得到了富裕基金会的大力帮助，而教师、家长和当地社区的帮助却很少。这套标准并没有反映公共教育所服务的许多学生群体的经验，没有反映许多家长对他们希望在教育中看到的东西的关注，而且这套标准实际上是对考试和惩罚制度的双重强化，而事实证明，这种制度是改善公共教育的错误做法。

## Poland

## 波兰

Polish education reform of 2017 is a joke. It is a well-intended effort that resulted in monumental chaos compounded by nationwide teacher strikes. Naturally, the [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum) was the target of the reform as well. The opposition is united in its condemnation. The ruling Law and Justice party *"changed the school curriculum to reflect and promote nationalistic and fundamentalist Catholic sentiments, which bought the support of the Church with hefty donations"* ([source](http://politicalcritique.org/cee/poland/2017/smolenski-autocracy-pis-regime-kaczynski-judiciary/)). For more see: [Polish education reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Polish_education_reform), and [Polish nationalistic history curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/History_curriculum_can_shape_nationalist_attitudes).

波兰2017年的教育改革是一个笑话。这是一项用心良苦的努力，结果造成了不朽的混乱，再加上全国范围内的教师罢工。自然，课程也是改革的目标。反对派一致谴责。执政的法律与公正党 "修改学校课程，以反映和宣扬民族主义和原教旨主义的天主教情绪，这就用巨额捐款买到了教会的支持"（来源）。更多内容请见。波兰教育改革，和波兰民族主义历史课程。

I pay little attention to similar reforms. They change little at the core of the [problem of schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_schooling). However, in the context of knowledge diversity I should mention a pet peeve of mine. In a textbook intended for 7 year olds and named *"Tropiciele" ("Pathfinders")*, one of the chapters perpetuates the undying [myth of the dangers of cold](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Myth:_We_catch_a_cold_from_cold). In a short story, a child chooses to dress up lightly in winter. "Wise" granny tells the kid to dress up well. His well-dressed friends laugh at the kid (this is a threat of [bullying](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bullying) to pass the erroneous indoctrination message). The story ends with a moral: the day after dressing "badly", the kid sneezes and coughs, and is penalized by missing a trip to the cinema with dad. In addition to promoting pseudoscience, the story got so many things wrong, I can only conclude it was written by someone born in the 1930s. Unfortunately, the list of "experts" includes more than a dozen of ladies that makes attributions hard. Fully blown symptoms showed up in 24 hours. In case of common cold, this could only happened in immunologically weakened individuals (e.g. due to [sleep deprivation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation)). The value of time with dad is dropping from generation to generation. Too many parents delegate parenting to schools, and the best connections kids usually have is with their peers. Last but not least, not many kids crave cinema in the era of Netflix and YouTube. The book is a prime case of silly indoctrination based fake wisdom and the deployment of social pressure. Factual errors abound throughout the book. Even [early waking](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alarm_clock) is touted as a "virtue" in which kids should imitate their self-disciplined and hard-working teacher. I pity the kid who gets fooled! Luckily, reality shows that infantile books like this only cause a wave of yawns in the class. The myth of catching cold from cold is lodged culturally well enough to seep in anyway.

我很少关注类似的改革。它们在学校教育的核心问题上变化不大。然而，在知识多样性的背景下，我应该提到我的一个小毛病。在一本为7岁儿童编写的名为 "Tropiciele"（"探路者"）的教科书中，有一章延续了寒冷危险的不朽神话。在一个小故事中，一个孩子选择在冬天轻装上阵。"聪明 "的奶奶告诉孩子要好好打扮。他那些穿得好的朋友们都嘲笑这个孩子（这是为了传递错误的教化信息，以欺负为威胁）。故事的结尾有一个寓意：穿得 "不好看 "的第二天，孩子就打喷嚏、咳嗽，被罚错过和爸爸去看电影。除了宣扬伪科学，这个故事还弄错了很多东西，我只能断定它是上世纪30年代出生的人写的。不幸的是，"专家 "名单中包括十几位女士，这让归属变得很困难。全面爆发的症状在24小时内出现。如果是普通感冒，这只可能发生在免疫力较弱的人身上（例如由于睡眠不足）。和爸爸在一起的时间的价值正在一代一代地下降。太多的父母将育儿工作委托给学校，而孩子们通常拥有的最好的联系是与同龄人的联系。最后但并非最不重要的是，在Netflix和YouTube的时代，没有多少孩子渴望电影。这本书是一个基于假智慧的愚蠢灌输和社会压力部署的典型案例。书中的事实错误比比皆是。连早起都被吹捧为孩子们应该模仿自律勤奋的老师的 "美德"。上当受骗的孩子真可怜! 还好，现实表明，这样幼稚的书本只会在班上引起一阵阵的哈欠。反正感冒着凉的神话在文化上已经根深蒂固，足以渗入。

## Science curriculum

## 科学课程

You may say that my examples are all highly political, and they should not predicate on the validity of common core in science. After all, 2+2=4 is not debatable. I disagree.

你可能会说，我的例子都是高度政治化的，它们不应该以科学中的共同核心的有效性为前提。毕竟，2+2=4是没有争议的。我不同意。

It only takes a few months of classroom time for kids to be fed up with simple calculations as demanded by the curriculum. One kid may prefer to count fish in his tank. Another will obsessively count the candy to share with his siblings. Instead, they are all force-fed with the same materials from the puerile textbook set. It gets worse when a kid got some true interest in science. Counting planets or ants may be infinitely more engaging. Last but not least, there is the ultimate destroyer of the interest in schooling: [videogames](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Videogames). There is no better way to develop a good number sense than to get immersed in virtual reality where numbers abound. See: [Videogames are better than teachers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Videogames_are_better_than_teachers).

只需要几个月的课堂时间，孩子们就会厌倦课程所要求的简单计算。一个孩子可能更喜欢数鱼缸里的鱼。另一个会痴迷地数着糖果与兄弟姐妹分享。相反，他们都被强行灌输了一套幼稚的教科书中的相同材料。当一个孩子对科学有了一些真正的兴趣时，情况会变得更糟。数行星或蚂蚁可能会有无限的吸引力。最后但并非最不重要的，是学校教育兴趣的最终破坏者：电子游戏。没有什么比沉浸在数字泛滥的虚拟现实中更好的方法来培养良好的数字意识了。请看：电子游戏比老师好。

However, the problem with science curriculum is not just about the method of delivery. Science is perpetually rife with disagreement.

然而，科学课程的问题不仅仅是授课方法的问题。科学永远充斥着分歧。

Take my pet meme I want to spread: **alarm clock is a brain destroyer!**.

就拿我想传播的宠物备忘录来说吧：闹钟是个脑力破坏者！

I do not recall ever learning **a single thing** about sleep physiology during my 26 long years of schooling. This is particularly bad as I am a biologist! Instead, I was regularly penalized for treating sleep seriously. My being late for school was always part of my inseparable label of a *"kid with behavioral problems"*. In my teens, I literally tried to explain to my teachers that a "well rested human being is a better member of society". I met no sympathy! Today, we literally make kids sick by waking them up early for school, and then we tell them this is "[good for immunity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_infections)".

我不记得在我26年漫长的求学生涯中，曾经学过一丁点关于睡眠生理学的知识。这一点尤其糟糕，因为我是一名生物学家! 相反，我经常因为认真对待睡眠而受到惩罚。我上学迟到一直是我离不开的 "行为问题孩子 "标签的一部分。在十几岁的时候，我真的试图向老师解释 "休息好的人是社会中更好的一员"。我没有得到任何同情! 今天，我们把孩子们早早叫醒上学，然后告诉他们这样做 "有利于提高免疫力"，这简直是在让孩子们生病。

Now imagine a fictional scenario in which we develop a new curriculum that would finally give sleep due credit.

现在想象一个虚构的场景，我们开发了一个新的课程，终于可以给睡眠应有的评价。

What if that curriculum was written by Dr Jerome Siegel (see: [If you do not sleep, you die!](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!)) or by Dr Jim Horne or Dr Daniel Kripke (see: [How long should we sleep?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_long_should_we_sleep%3F))? All those reputable scientists have rich and precious contributions to science. However, with all due respect, I would want to read that curriculum before I deemed it fit for the imposition on young minds.

如果这个课程是由Jerome Siegel博士（见：如果你不睡觉，你就会死！）或Jim Horne博士或Daniel Kripke博士（见：我们应该睡多久？）所有这些著名的科学家都对科学有丰富而珍贵的贡献。然而，恕我直言，我想先读一读那套课程，然后再认为它适合强加给年轻人的头脑。

Curiosity is a great motor for scientific progress, however, scientific feuds are equally helpful. If we feed all kids with the same set of dry facts, we sow seeds of intellectual stagnation.

好奇心是科学进步的巨大动力，然而，科学之争也同样有帮助。如果我们用同一套枯燥的事实喂养所有的孩子，我们就会播下智力停滞的种子。

Disagreements in science are the engine of progress

科学上的分歧是进步的动力
