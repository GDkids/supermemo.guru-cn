Myth: Schools are needed due to the slow evolution of human cognition

误区：由于人类认知进化缓慢，需要学校。

Some educators and anthropologists believe that the evolution cannot keep up with the cognitive demands of modern society. In that belief, children can easily learn walking and speech on their own. They can easily acquire social knowledge, or folk knowledge. However, humans are allegedly inherently weak at mastering academic knowledge, e.g. mathematics.

一些教育家和人类学家认为，进化跟不上现代社会的认知需求。在这种信念下，儿童可以很容易地自己学会走路和说话。他们可以很容易地获得社会知识，或民间知识。然而，据称人类在掌握学术知识，如数学方面天生就很弱。

This harmful myth is used by proponents of direct instruction to justify the existence of schools and the need for teachers. D.C. Geary and D.B. Berch wrote in their book (abridged):

这种有害的神话被直接教学的支持者用来证明学校的存在和教师的必要性。D.C.Geary和D.B.Berch在他们的书（节选）中写道：

Over the past several millennia, groups have increased substantially in size and economic diversification and some individuals within these groups have discovered better ways of producing food (e.g. agriculture crops), conducting commerce (e.g. monetary systems), and understanding the natural world (i.e. science). These advances have provided many benefits, but many of them have outpaced evolution’s ability to adapt cognitive and motivational systems such that children easily learn the associated competencies. In other words, cultural innovations and brain and cognitive evolution are out of sync, creating a gap between what we are motivated to learn and what we easily learn and the competencies needed to live well in the modern world. Schools are one of these innovations; schools do not exist in traditional societies where day-to-day living does not require reading, writing, or arithmetic. Within the modern world, these are now considered rudimentary competencies, and we expect all children, not just the elite, to acquire them

在过去的几千年里，群体的规模大幅增加，经济多样化，这些群体中的一些个体发现了更好的生产食物（如农作物）、开展商业（如货币体系）和理解自然界（即科学）的方法。这些进步提供了许多好处，但其中许多进步已经超过了进化论调整认知和动机系统的能力，使儿童很容易学会相关能力。换句话说，文化创新与大脑和认知的进化是不同步的，在我们被激励学习的东西和我们容易学习的东西与在现代世界中良好生活所需的能力之间产生了差距。学校就是这些创新之一，在传统社会中，学校是不存在的，因为在传统社会中，日常生活不需要阅读、写作或算术。在现代世界里，这些现在被认为是基本的能力，我们希望所有的孩子，而不仅仅是精英阶层，都能获得这些能力。

In reality, declarative knowledge is stored in the neocortex using principles that are no different in between the shape of a milk bottle, and the shape of a tesseract. The key difference between the two is only in the distance that separates them from primary perception. All abstract models are encoded using the same principles as the model of a friend's face.

在现实中，陈述性知识是用牛奶瓶的形状，和魔方的形状之间的原理存储在新皮层中的，这两者之间没有什么不同。两者之间的关键区别只在于它们与初级知觉之间的距离。所有的抽象模型都是使用与朋友的脸部模型相同的原理进行编码的。

There is no cognitive deficit. As for "motivation system", all primary motivation in learning is an expression of need (see: Knowledge valuation network), and it is little wonder than we seem more motivated to learn the difference between a friend and a foe than we are motivated to learn trigonometry. Still, there is no discontinuity in the toolset and strategies for learning trigonometry as soon as the need to learn arises.

不存在认知上的不足。至于 "动机系统"，学习中所有的初级动机都是需要的表现（见：知识估价网），比起学习三角函数的动机，我们学习朋友和敌人的区别似乎更有动力，这也就不足为奇了。不过，只要有了学习的需要，学习三角函数的工具集和策略还是没有断层的。

If schools provide fake motivation, we end up with fake learning

如果学校提供虚假的激励，我们最终会得到虚假的学习效果

If the myth of human limits was to be true, we would never witness a discovery. No school would ever teach about a new discovery because if the teacher knew it, the discovery would not be new. The authors circumvent that paradox by a claim that not all student have the cognitive capacity of Isaac Newton. In reality, all healthy kids have the basic cognitive toolset to reach the levels of Principia. It is the obstacles and tribulations of modern life that provide a never-ending distraction in this process. One of the most destructive forces that prevent the emergence of more Newtons is school itself. Newton's brain soared in times of freedom sparked by the plague. Kids are bound at school in the morning, and by homework or household chores in the evening. As a result they provide an illusion they are incapable of self-instruction. This way the enslavement continues and the myth is perpetuated even by the seemingly most informed minds in science.

如果人类极限的神话是真的，我们永远不会见证一个发现。任何学校都不会教授新的发现，因为如果老师知道，那么这个发现就不是新的。作者通过宣称并非所有学生都有牛顿的认知能力来规避这一悖论。实际上，所有健康的孩子都具备基本的认知工具，达到普林西娅的水平。正是现代生活中的障碍和磨难，在这个过程中提供了永无止境的干扰。阻碍更多牛顿出现的最具有破坏性的力量之一就是学校本身。牛顿的大脑在瘟疫引发的自由时代飞速发展。孩子们早上在学校被束缚，晚上被家庭作业或家务事束缚。结果他们提供了一种自己没有能力自学的假象。这样一来，奴役还在继续，甚至连科学界看似最懂行的人也在延续这个神话。

I am personally pretty adamant about the value of free learning due to the fact that in my decades of formal education, I have never tangibly benefited from being taught. Just the opposite, compulsory schooling stole decades of my life. It has also contributed strongly to my drive for writing this book

我个人是很坚持自由学习的价值的，由于在我几十年的正规教育中，我从来没有从受教育中得到明显的好处。恰恰相反，义务教育偷走了我几十年的人生。这也有力地促进了我写这本书的动力。
