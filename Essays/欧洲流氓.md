## Hall of Shame

Germany and Sweden stand in the Hall of Shame in the European Union. [Homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling) is banned in those countries. The best forms of learning for kids are illegal. Horror stories of home invasion by social workers and police are numerous. It would be enough to peek at Finland were excellent school system results in very low interest in homeschooling despite excellent stance on freedom. The ban will be overturned with a cultural shift towards understanding the science of learning. Before that happens, many kids will be denied their best options for growth.

Words from [Berlin Declaration (2012)](https://ghex.world/advocacy/declarations/berlin-declaration/) fit the context:

> We condemn the policies of those nations that prohibit the practice of home education and permit the persecution of home educating families through excessive or coercive fines, threats to parental custody and application of criminal sanctions

As for Finland, I wonder if their school systems isn't crafted to produce meek and obedient population (see: [Finnish school paradox](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Finnish_school_paradox)). A red flag indicator is the fact that Finland still disrupts young lives with [conscription](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conscription). When a citizen's initiative to abolish the concept in 2013 failed to receive sufficient support, I wondered if there aren't enough angry young man in Finland to change the status quo? Perhaps all that healthy anger is gradually extinguished by schooling? Is if fair that Bill Gates could devote all his youth to Microsoft while Linus Torvalds had to waste 11 months for the military service? Those 11 months might have changed history. Polish army tried to grab my neck in the year preceding [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). If they succeeded, emergence of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) apps after 1987 would be down to a lottery ticket.

## Who wants to ban homeschooling?

In reference to home education, there is some meeting of mind between socialists, progressives, atheists, multiculturalists, feminists, Swedish culture, and German culture. Feminists use schooling to free women. Atheists hope to kill religions. Egalitarians and socialists hope to educate kids "equally". Swedes love the social function of schools. Germans are fond of [ordnung](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ordnung) and Prussian discipline.

Legal regulations in education are an expression of the wish to control other people's minds

For an example of an appetite for legal control see: [Presumptive ban on homeschooling in the USA (Elizabeth Bartholet)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Elizabeth_Bartholet:_ignorant_attack_on_homeschooling)

## Common denominators

Both countries were pretty welcoming in the wave of immigration. However, their good hearts turned cold when it comes to upbringing. A non-Christian or non-European parent has little choice but to send her children early to daycare to begin the process of "integration" and "socialization". This has all the appearances of a warm welcome for labor and young blood while still being closed to foreign cultural influences.

Those countries provide an excellent illustration of [self-perpetuating cultural feedback loop of schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Phone_book). [Compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) makes it hard to see the benefits of [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning). Society believes that *"school is good"* and that more school is better. This provides a rich feeding ground for educational mythology such as [Digital Dementia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Digital_Dementia). An average German kid speaks poor English and has little idea of concepts such as [homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling), let alone [unschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Unschooling) or [democratic schools](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Democratic_school). An average German or Swedish citizen is pretty convinced that school is necessary due to the myth of the value of school socialization.

## Jan Björklund

[Jan Björklund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Björklund) (b. April 1962) is the bogeyman behind the [ban on homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling) in Sweden. As Education Minister 2007-2014, he introduced wide-sweeping and controversial reforms. He blamed falling performance of Swedish students on Social Democrats. Despite being a leader of a party, which is liberal in name, Björklund has committed the most illiberal crime of education: he banned homeschooling.

The entire Björklund's own education took place in military institutions of learning. He advanced to the rank of major and knows about military matters infinitely more than he knows about education. Appropriately, as an expression of his authoritarian character, most of his ideas are disciplinarian in nature. New law makes it possible to confiscate child's cell phone. This reminds me how traumatic was the day when [my worst teacher](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/My_worst_teacher) confiscated my beloved zoo postcards. This is reminiscent of prisons, not schools. In Björklund's thinking, again, I hear echoes of the 1920s and 1930s, Prussian discipline, military service, homogeneous thinking, and conformity deprived of all signs of individual creativity. In a typical show of disciplinarian ignorance, Björklund compared [democratic schools](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Democratic_school) to hospitals run by patients. Patients know a few things better than doctors: they can feel they own pain, they often know their disease history better, they know their habits and preferences, and, most of all, they usually care about their own health more than anyone else in the world. However, students have been equipped by evolution with the best learning guidance system: the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) (see: [Optimality of the learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimality_of_the_learn_drive). Students know far better, which portions of the learning material fit the [semantic structure](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Semantic_network) of knowledge stored in their long-term memory. Teachers have no insight into individual brains and only comply with a schedule imposed by national [curricula](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum). This model of learning fits perfectly into Björklund's militaristic view of what school should accomplish. When Sweden suffered the "[PISA](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA) shock", Bjorklund would follow a typical military prescription: teacher authority, classroom discipline, more grading, earlier assessment. Björklund wanted to terminate the Swedish free school experiment by mass re-nationalization [[1\]](http://www.thelocal.se/20140210/sweden-failed-in-decentralizing-schools-report). If I wanted a new Napoleonic army for Sweden, I would choose Björklund to run the education system.

When Björklund said school should add priority to history and religion, he again played a hand of God over child's mind. When it comes to religion, National Agency for Education would have all major religions treated equally. God Björklund said *"Christianity should receive higher priority"*. If the child wants to focus on biology, his history should be deferred to the time when his brain matures to understand its importance (as it was the very late case in my own life)(see: [Learning history](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history)). If the kid shows no interest in religion, he should have an option to defer that subject as well. On the other hand, if someone comes to school with strong Christian, or perhaps Muslim convictions, he should also have an option of studying the area that keeps him passionate. One of interesting Björklund ideas is to introduce compulsory Chinese on the assumption China will soon be a dominant world power. Where Sweden got a lot of success in social engineering, Björklund's mind-engineering is a step too far. No ministry should ever rule over people's minds, and kids should be free from indoctrination most of all.

When Tobias Krantz left the post of Minister for Higher Education and Research in 2009, the post was abolished and the duties were taken over by Jan Bjorklund who got no academic qualifications for the job.

## Anna Ekström

In October 2014, Green party's Gustav Fridolin, just 31-years-old took the post of the Minister of Education. Born in 1983, fluent in English, Fridolin believed reforms were urgent. However, when Anna Ekström (b. 1959) took over the post, things returned to the same old mode of reasoning ([source](https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2019-08-15---minister-of-education-anna-ekström-says-no-to-more-homeschooling-.ryVcojr7NB.html)):

> In Sweden, the school law applies, and for Swedish children, the [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum) applies, and what is in the **curriculum is very important for children** and students to learn in order for them to **do well in life**

Like many before her, Ekström believes in the oxymoron of the right to [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) ([source](https://www.denandraresan.com/the-history-of-school-in-sweden-and-the-situation-today/)):

> One of the reasons why we have **[compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling)** is that we **allow** the children’s **right** to education before the parents’ right to decide on their children

Assuming the translations are correct, Anna Ekström seems to be [reading from the same old phone book](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Phone_book). There is no room for deeper understanding of [high quality learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning).

## Contrasts

Recent coronavirus pandemic provides a fantastic research ground for those who study how knowledge affects policy. At the time when knowledge of the virus is limited, and knowledge of optimum pathways to herd immunity is slow to percolate, leaders, parliaments, states, cities and provinces adopt policies that are as different as chalk from cheese. The changes in policy are sensitive to the inflow of new knowledge, and to changes in personal opinion. In Poland, we had a ridiculous two week ban on entry to woods and (empty) beaches. It came and went away like a case of bad flu. Clearly, it was a government's shot in the foot (or rather in national immunity). In this chaotic time, leaders determine national outcomes. Ignorance determines who lives and who dies.

I like [David Katz](https://youtu.be/Lze-rMYLf2E)'s position on tackling the crisis. I came to the exact same conclusions when I was diverted by police from my usual jogging route in a scenic abandoned path via woods (Apr 9, 2020). In society's best interest I should catch the virus (assuming I would not die). Naturally, this would not happen in cold wind in empty woods, which was my best place to actually stay healthy.

I was pretty impressed that Sweden decided to take the boldest steps in Europe. If policies are determined by an epidemiologist, they are more likely to make sense than those set by politicians. However, Anders Tegnell made a comment that hinted at his "Swedish mindset": *"children must go to school so that nurses could go to work"*. Moreover, cruelly, elderly care centers contribute half of the death statistics. This reminds me the ominous words of late Raymond Moore: *"[the earlier you institutionalize your children, the earlier they will institutionalize you!](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Raymond_Moore:_On_early_institutionalization)"*

In contrast, Germany appeared to be rather heavy-handed. Under the leadership of the scientist-in-chief, Angela Merkel, they even need to wear mandatory face masks in public. Not often do I see police clash with protesters in the ordnung country.

Policy contrasts should not cover for the degree of conformity in society. Rules and recommendations are adhered to pretty well in both Sweden and Germany. In contrast, in the US, citizens can shout their way out of freedom-limiting restrictions. It is impossible to say what balance of conformity and resistance is optimum. However, it is pretty easy to claim that civic knowledge and general knowledge are universally helpful. This is why all limits on [freedom of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) are harmful.

The role of civic conformity is less decisive in knowledgeable societies

## Future

The main forces that will overturn the present status quo are:

- decline in mental health of the young generation
- decline in innovation
- grass-root protest of children who have first-hand knowledge of the inefficiency of [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) (with help of personalities such as Greta Thunberg)
- on-line access to knowledge of enlightened educational solutions employed around the world
