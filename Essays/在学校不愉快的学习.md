# 在学校不愉快的学习

Most children don't like school. Many children [hate school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_kids_hate_school%3F). Why do we then keep the schools open?

大多数孩子不喜欢学校。许多孩子[讨厌学校](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_kids_hate_school%3F)。那为什么我们要让学校继续开放？

## Why schools seem to work?

## 为什么学校似乎是有效的？

For learning to be effective, it must be [pleasant](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning). You may then wonder how we can release millions of reasonably educated graduates from schools that are notoriously unpleasant. There are many factors contributing to that paradox:

为了使学习有效，它必须是[愉快的](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning)。然后你可能会想，我们怎么能从那些臭名昭著的不愉快的学校里释放出数百万受过合理教育的毕业生。有许多因素促成了这一悖论：

- some kids enjoy school 
- 有些孩子喜欢学校
- some gifted kids ignore school and learn on their own 
- 一些有天赋的孩子无视学校，自行学习
- mass of bad learning can smuggle a bit of good learning
- 大量不好的学习可以偷带一点好的学习

The sad truth needs to be stated loud: **school education is predominantly inferior and school experience is predominantly unpleasant**. Schools utilize a tiny fraction of the human brain's potential to learn. See: [Why schools fail](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_schools_fail).

可悲的事实需要大声说出来。**学校教育绝大多数是低劣的，学校经历绝大多数是令人不快的**。学校只利用了人脑学习潜力的极小部分。见：[学校为什么失败](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_schools_fail)。

To make things worse, teachers often [encourage learning without full comprehension](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do_not_memorize_before_you_understand).

更糟的是，教师经常[鼓励在没有充分理解的情况下学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do_not_memorize_before_you_understand)。

In this short section, I will try to illustrate the problem with an example that will hopefully help young people gauge their own approach to learning.

在这一小节中，我将尝试用一个例子来说明这个问题，希望能帮助年轻人衡量自己的学习方法。

> Carlo had 11 children. His fourth child was a boy born on a hot August day. The boy was nicknamed "Little". When Little was 10, he was sent to a good school. At school, Little was ridiculed for his height, low social standing, and his accent. Despite all the ridicule, he was a good student and received a good education. He mastered French. With his brother Joseph, Little attended college. Despite his high intelligence, Little graduated 42 in a class of 52. His dream was to join the army. He would read a lot about history and geography. He married at the age of 26, but he and his wife Rose could not have children despite a decade of trying. In desperation, Little divorced his wife. At the age of 41, he married again. His new wife Marie was only 19 years old. In a letter to her father, Marie wrote "He loves me very much. I respond to his love sincerely. There is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist". Marie delivered a son Franz within a year. At 2.5 months, Franz was baptised. The ceremony was held in an beautiful cathedral and was impressive. From a very young age, Franz received a great deal of schooling at home in religion and philosophy. At the age of 8 he decided to become a soldier when he grows up. He would learn German, Italian and mathematics. Franz was intelligent and focused. Unlike his father, he was very tall. The story does not have a happy ending though, Franz died young just 11 years after Little's own death of cancer. At the age of 21, Franz died of tuberculosis.

> 卡罗有11个孩子。他的第四个孩子是个男孩，出生在一个炎热的八月天。这个男孩的绰号是 "小"。小小10岁时，他被送进了一所好学校。在学校里，李特因其身高、社会地位低下和口音而受到嘲笑。尽管有这些嘲笑，但他是个好学生，接受了良好的教育。他掌握了法语。与他的兄弟约瑟夫一起，利特尔上了大学。尽管他的智力很高，但利特尔在一个52人的班级中只毕业了42人。他的梦想是参军。他将大量阅读有关历史和地理的书籍。他在26岁时结婚，但他和他的妻子罗丝尽管经过十年的努力，还是没能生孩子。在绝望中，李特与妻子离婚。在41岁时，他再次结婚。他的新妻子玛丽当时只有19岁。在给她父亲的信中，玛丽写道："他非常爱我。我真诚地回应了他的爱。他身上有一种非常迷人、非常渴望的东西，让人无法抗拒"。玛丽在一年内生了一个儿子弗朗茨。2.5个月时，弗朗茨接受了洗礼。仪式在一个美丽的大教堂举行，令人印象深刻。从很小的时候起，弗朗茨就在家里接受了大量的宗教和哲学方面的教育。8岁时，他决定长大后要成为一名军人。他将学习德语、意大利语和数学。弗朗茨很聪明，也很专注。与他的父亲不同，他的个子很高。但这个故事并没有一个圆满的结局，弗朗茨在利特尔自己死于癌症后仅11年就英年早逝。在21岁时，弗朗茨死于肺结核。
