# 在课堂上使用间隔重复软件的这七年

## Description

## 说明

This is a reflective essay and report on my experiences using [Spaced Repetition](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced repetition) Software (SRS) in an American high school classroom. It follows my [2015](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom) and [2016](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom) posts on the same topic.

这是一篇反思性文章，用[间隔重复]来报告我的经历(http://www.gwern.net/Spaced 重复）软件（SRS）在美国高中教室。我的[2015](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom)和[2016](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom)关于同一主题的帖子。

Because I value concise summaries in non-fiction, I provide one immediately below. However, I also believe in the power of narrative, in carefully unfolding a story so as to maximize reader engagement and impact. As I have applied such narrative considerations in writing this post, I consider the following summary to be a spoiler.

因为我重视非小说中的简明摘要，所以我在下面提供了一个。然而，我也相信叙事的力量，在仔细展开一个故事，以最大限度地提高读者的参与和影响。由于我在写这篇文章时运用了这种叙述性的考虑，我认为下面的总结是一个破坏者。

I’ll let you decide what to do with that information.

我让你决定怎么处理这些信息。

## Summary (spoilers)

## 总结（扰流板）

My earlier push for classroom SRS solutions was driven by a belief I came to see as fallacious: that forgetting is the undoing of learning. This epistemic shift drove me to abandon designs for a custom app that would have integrated whole-class and individual SRS functions.

我早先推动课堂解决方案的动机是一个我认为是错误的信念：遗忘就是学习的终结。这种认识上的转变促使我放弃了一个定制应用程序的设计，该应用程序将集成整个类和单独的SRS功能。

While I still see value in classroom use of Spaced Repetition Software, especially in basic language acquisition, I have greatly reduced its use in my own classes.

虽然我仍然看到在课堂上使用间隔重复软件的价值，特别是在基础语言习得方面，但我已经大大减少了在我自己的课堂上使用间隔重复软件。

In my third year of experiments (2016-17), I used a windfall of classroom computers to give students supervised time to independently study using an SRS app with individual profiles. I found longer-term average performance to be slightly worse than under the whole-class group study model, though students of high intelligence and motivation saw slight improvements.

在我第三年的实验（2016-17）中，我使用了大量的教室电脑，让学生在监督下有时间使用带有个人资料的SRS应用程序独立学习。我发现长期平均成绩略差于全班小组学习模式，尽管高智商和高动机的学生略有改善。

## Intro and response to Piotr Woźniak

## 介绍与回应 Piotr Woźniak

I have recently received a number of requests to revisit the topic of classroom SRS after years of silence on the subject. Understandably, the term “postmortem” has come up more than once. Did I hit a dead end? Do I still use it?

我最近收到了一些请求，希望在多年的沉默之后，重新探讨课堂SRS这个话题。可以理解，“死后”这个词已经出现了不止一次。我走到死胡同了吗？我还用吗？

Also, I was informed that SRS founding father Piotr Woźniak recently added [a page](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition_does_not_work_in_a_classroom) to his SuperMemo wiki in which he quoted me at length and claimed that SRS doesn’t belong in the classroom.

另外，我还得知SRS的创始人Piotr Woź尼亚克最近添加了[一页](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition_does_not_work_in_a_classroom)在他的超级记忆维基上，他详细引用了我的话，声称SRS不属于教室。

Well, I don’t have much in the way of rebuttal, because Woźniak’s main goal with the page seems to be to use my experience as ammunition against the perpetuation of school-as-we-know-it, which seems like a worthy crusade. He introduces my earlier classroom SRS posts by saying, “This teacher could write the same articles with the same conclusions. Only the terminology would differ.” I’ll take that as high praise.

嗯，我没有太多反驳的余地，因为ź尼亚克用网页的主要目的似乎是用我的经验作为弹药，反对我们所知道的学校的永久化，这似乎是一个值得的十字军东征。他在介绍我之前的课堂文章时说：“这位老师可以用同样的结论写同样的文章。只有术语会有所不同，“我认为这是高度赞扬。

If I were to quibble, it would be with the part shortly after this, where he says:

如果我要吹毛求疵的话，那就是在这之后不久的那部分，他说：

> The entire analysis is made with an important assumption: *"school is good, school is inevitable, and school is here to stay, so we better learn to live with it"*.

>整个分析都是基于一个重要的假设：“学校是好的，学校是不可避免的，学校将继续存在，所以我们最好学会接受它”*。

Inevitable? Maybe. Here to stay? Realistically, yes. But good? At best, I might describe our educational system as an “[inadequate equilibrium](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oLGCcbnvabyibnG9d/p/x5ASTMPKPowLKpLpZ)”. At worst? A pit so deep we still don’t know what’s at the bottom, except that it eats souls.

不可避免？也许 吧。留下来？事实上，是的。但是好吗？充其量，我可以把我们的教育系统描述为一个“[不充分的均衡](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oLGCcbnvabyibnG9d/p/x5ASTMPKPowLKpLpZ)”. 最坏的情况是？一个如此深的坑，我们仍然不知道底部是什么，只知道它会吞噬灵魂。

Other than that, let me reiterate my long-running agreement with Woźniak that SRS is best when used by a self-motivated individual, and that my classroom antics are an ugly hack around the fact that self-motivation is a rare element this deep in the mines.

除此之外，请允许我重申我与Wo的长期协议źniak认为SRS在自我激励的人身上是最好的，我在课堂上的滑稽动作是一个丑陋的恶作剧，因为自我激励在矿井深处是一个罕见的元素。

Anyone who can show us a way out will have my attention. In the meantime, I’ll do my best to keep a light on.

任何能给我们指出出路的人都会引起我的注意。同时，我会尽我所能让灯亮着。

## Prologue

##序言

At the end of my 2016 post, I teased a peek at a classroom SRS+ app I was preparing to build. It would have married whole-class and individual study functions with some other clever features to reduce teacher workload.

在我2016年的帖子结尾，我回顾了我准备构建的教室SRS+应用程序。它将整个班级和个人的学习功能与其他一些巧妙的功能结合起来，以减少教师的工作量。

I had a 10k word document in hand: a mix of rationale, feature descriptions, and hypothetical “user stories”. I wasn’t looking for funding or a co-founder, just some technical suggestions and moral support. I would have been my own first user, and I had to keep my day job for that anyway.

我手头有一个10万字的文档：基本原理、功能描述和假设的“用户故事”的混合体。我不是在寻求资金或联合创始人，只是一些技术建议和道德支持。我本来是我自己的第一个用户，无论如何我必须保留我的日常工作。

But each time I read my draft, I had this growing, sickening sense that I was lying to myself and my potential customers, like a door-to-door missionary choking back a tide of latent atheism. And I should know, because the last time I had felt this kind of queasiness I was a door-to-door missionary choking back a tide of latent atheism.

但每次我读我的草稿时，我都有一种越来越严重的、令人恶心的感觉，那就是我在欺骗自己和我的潜在客户，就像一个挨家挨户的传教士，扼杀着潜在无神论的浪潮。我应该知道，因为上一次我感到这种不安的时候，我是一个挨家挨户的传教士，扼杀着潜在的无神论浪潮。

I thought maybe this was just the kind of general self-doubt common to anyone undertaking something audacious, but I paused my work on it for another school year while I tried the obvious thing: providing students individual SRS app profiles and supervised class time in which to use them.

我想这可能只是一种普遍的自我怀疑，任何人都在做一些大胆的事情，但我又暂停了一学年的工作，而我尝试了一件显而易见的事情：为学生提供个人SRS应用程序配置文件，并监督他们在课堂上的使用时间。

This is a two-part essay, and in Part 2, I’ll tell you how that went. But in Part 1, I’m going to make the case that Part 2 doesn’t matter very much.

这是一篇分两部分的文章，在第二部分，我将告诉你这是怎么回事。但在第一部分，我要说明第二部分并不重要。

# Part 1: Everybody Poops

#第一部分：每个人都大便

## A great and terrible vision

##伟大而可怕的景象

As I wrapped up my Third Year experiment, I again tried to sort out my feelings about my visionary SRS app design, which I hadn’t updated despite a year of fresh experience. Was it just self-doubt?

当我完成第三年的实验时，我再次尝试整理我对我富有远见的SRS应用程序设计的感觉，尽管有了一年的新鲜体验，我还是没有更新。只是自我怀疑？

The fact that I could only code at a minimal hobbyist level didn’t feel like the biggest hurdle. I think I could have picked up enough skill in that area. But even with a magical ability to translate my vision into code, I would have been up against a daunting base rate of failure for education startups. Also, I didn’t consider myself a very typical teacher: What sounded brilliant and intuitive to me would probably seem pointless and nonsensical to 95% of my peers.

事实上，我只能在一个最小的爱好者水平上编写代码，这并不是最大的障碍。我想我本可以在那方面学到足够的技能。但即使拥有将我的愿景转化为代码的神奇能力，我也会面临教育初创企业令人望而生畏的基本失败率。而且，我也不认为自己是一个非常典型的老师：对我来说，那些听起来很有才华和直觉的东西，对我95%的同龄人来说可能是毫无意义和荒谬的。

Still, I pulled out my Eye of Agamotto and checked out all of the futures where I developed the app. In almost all of these, nothing came of it. But in the few where my app saw high adoption, the result was… dystopia! Students turned against their teachers, and teachers against their students. Homework stretched to eternity. Millions of children cursed my name. The ‘me’ in these futures wore an ignominious goatee and a haunted stare. 

尽管如此，我还是把目光投向了Agacomit，查看了我开发应用程序的所有未来。在几乎所有这些，没有任何结果。但在少数几个我的应用程序被高度采纳的地方，结果是……反乌托邦！学生们转而反对他们的老师，老师也反对他们的学生。家庭作业延伸到永恒。数以百万计的孩子诅咒我的名字。这些未来中的“我”留着一个不光彩的山羊胡和一个鬼魅的眼神。

Used judiciously for the right concepts, in the right courses, by the right teachers, I still think my imagined app could be a powerful tool. But I don’t see any way to keep it from being abused. Well-intentioned teachers would put too much into it and demand too much from students. Any safeguards I put in to prevent this would just invite my app to be outcompeted by an imitator who removed these safeguards (which would seem arbitrary and restricting to most users).

正确的概念，正确的课程，正确的老师明智的使用，我仍然认为我想象中的应用程序可能是一个强大的工具。但我看不出有什么办法能阻止它被滥用。好心的老师投入太多，对学生要求太高。我为防止这种情况而设置的任何保护措施都只会让我的应用程序被一个模仿者超越，而模仿者则会取消这些保护措施（这对大多数用户来说似乎是武断和限制性的）。

I’m convinced of this because the me who wrote the original “A Year of Spaced Repetition…” post would have abused it. Let’s see... He was averaging [*seven*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#The_procedure) new cards a day? (That’s 2-3 times what I would recommend today.) He [uncapped](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Baby_cards_need_immediate_love) the 20 new card/day limit? He knew even then that he was adding too many cards, but [failed to cut back the following year](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Autopilot_years)? I’m not encouraged.

我相信这一点，因为我谁写了原来的“一年的间隔重复…”帖子会滥用它。让我们看看。。。他平均分为7分(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#The_procedure)每天有新卡吗(这是我今天推荐的2-3倍。）他[不封顶](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Baby_cards_need_immediate_love)20张新卡/天限额？即使在那时，他也知道自己增加了太多的牌，但（第二年没能减少）(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Autopilot_years)? 我不受鼓励。

“But wait,” you say. “You didn’t think you were a typical teacher. Maybe a typical teacher could be trusted?”

“等等，”你说你以为你不是一个典型的老师。也许一个典型的老师可以信任？”

No.

不。

## In defense of forgetting

##为了防止遗忘

The “problem” is that teachers instinctively introduce far more content than students can be expected to remember. This was obvious to me when I was averaging seven new cards a day, which still felt like a brutal triage of my total content.

“问题”在于，教师本能地介绍的内容远远超出了学生的预期记忆。这对我来说是很明显的，当时我平均每天有七张新卡，这仍然让我觉得是对我全部内容的残酷分类。

Covering more material than can be retained isn’t bad teaching, though. In fact, it’s a good and necessary practice. Content — the more the merrier — is the training data the brain uses to form and refine mental models of the universe.[[1\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=pgjuosHYnJCzjFkDC#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA) These models tend to be long-lived, and allow the brain to re-learn the content more deeply and efficiently if it ever comes up again. They also allow it to absorb new-but-conceptually-adjacent contents more readily. In cognition, as in nutrition, you are what you eat — and good digestion naturally produces solid waste. The original training data is subject to lossy compression, with only a few random fragments left whole and unforgotten. (Tippecanoe, and Tyler Too! The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!) Such recollections are corn kernels bobbing top-side up in a turd floating down the river Lethe. 

但是，覆盖比可以保留的更多的材料并不是一个坏的教学方法。事实上，这是一个好的和必要的做法。内容越多越好，是大脑用来形成和完善宇宙心理模型的训练数据。[[1\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=pgjuosHYnJCzjFkDC#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)这些模型往往寿命很长，如果内容再次出现，让大脑更深入、更有效地重新学习。它们还允许它更容易地吸收新的但概念上相邻的内容。在认知上，就像在营养上一样，你就是你吃的东西——良好的消化自然会产生固体废物。原始的训练数据经过有损压缩，只有少数随机片段是完整的和未得到的(皮卡诺，还有泰勒！线粒体是细胞的动力这样的回忆是玉米粒在一个大便里上下浮动，顺着莱特河而下。

This is normal and fine. *Regular*, even.

这很正常也很好*常规*，偶数。

But the educational establishment doesn’t see it that way. The teacher I was seven years ago didn’t see it that way. And I now realize that the teacher I was five and six years ago had queasy feelings because he was *starting* to see it that way. Following my gut, without fully understanding or even entirely registering what I was doing, I slowly turned around and started walking the other way, abandoning my app design and the unfinished “Third Year” report.

但教育机构并不这么认为。我七年前的老师可不这么看。我现在意识到我五六年前的老师有恶心的感觉，因为他开始这么看。按照我的直觉，没有完全理解，甚至没有完全注册我在做什么，我慢慢地转过身，开始走另一条路，放弃了我的应用程序设计和未完成的“第三年”报告。

The orthodox view equates forgetting with failure. It’s not “Everybody poops”. It’s “Poop is inadequate. How can we get more corn, less poop?” This belief is implicit whenever [someone](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Days_off_suck) laments the “summer slide” , or opines that students missing school during the Covid pandemic are “losing” months of learning — as if kids are spinning their progress meters backwards, just pooping away without anyone trying to stop them. Under this view, we keep kids in school partly to stop the leaks, and partly to stuff them with new knowledge faster than they can expunge old knowledge.

正统观点把遗忘等同于失败。不是“每个人都大便”。是“大便不足”。我们怎样才能得到更多的玉米，更少的粪便？”这种信念在任何时候（某人）都是隐含的(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Days_off_suck)感叹“夏日滑梯”，或者有人认为，在Covid大流行期间缺课的学生正在“失去”几个月的学习时间——就好像孩子们正在向后旋转进度表，只是在没有人试图阻止他们的情况下大便而去。在这种观点下，我们让孩子们留在学校，一方面是为了阻止泄密，另一方面是为了让他们更快地掌握新知识，而不是清除旧知识。

If this is how you see education, SRS is a tool to keep students from pooping. It offers the tantalizing possibility of learning without forgetting. Two steps forward, no steps back. Why *wouldn’t* you push it as hard as possible?

如果这就是你对教育的看法，那么SRS就是一种防止学生拉屎的工具。它提供了学习而不遗忘的诱人可能性。向前两步，不后退。你为什么不尽可能用力推呢？

Don’t get me wrong. All else being equal, learning without forgetting would be great. But the most important effects of learning — lasting changes to our mental machinery — happen whether or not we forget the content. Once the lesson is over, dear teacher, your best shot at lasting growth has already left the harbor. So why are you still trying to hold back the tide? Why are you planning to punish your students for pooping on Tuesday, the day before your test, instead of Thursday, the day after it?[[2\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=uExirihC8QLDiXn2R#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)

别误会我。在其他条件相同的情况下，学习而不遗忘将是很好的。但是学习最重要的影响——对我们的心理机制的持久改变——发生在我们是否忘记内容的时候。一旦课程结束，亲爱的老师，你最好的持久成长的机会已经离开了港湾。那你为什么还想阻止潮流？为什么你打算惩罚你的学生在考试前一天的星期二而不是考试后一天的星期四大便？[[2\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=uExirihC8QLDiXn2R#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)

## In defense of remembering

## 为了保护记忆

This is not a “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Forgetting” essay. I don’t love forgetting. I will be the first to argue the merits of not forgetting right away. The longer we can keep ideas floating around in our heads, the greater their “cross-section”, [as I put it in 2016](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Missing_out__free_association), with more opportunities to make associative connections that cause useful long-lived updates to our mental models.

这不是一篇“我如何学会停止忧虑和爱遗忘”的文章。我不喜欢忘记。我将第一个论证不要马上忘记的优点。我们能让想法在头脑中漂浮的时间越长，它们的“横截面”就越大，（正如我在2016年所说的那样）(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Missing_out__free_association),有更多的机会建立联想联系，从而对我们的心智模型进行长期有效的更新。

Unfortunately, I have not found SRS to be great at fostering the sorts of reflective mental states conducive to insight, except when studying on my own at a deliberately slow pace, as while on a walk. In such a use case, SRS no longer has quite the time-efficiency advantage that is its main selling point. The opportunity cost of using it goes up. In a whole-class SRS session, long reflective pauses between cards would invite frustration and misbehavior, and we wouldn’t get through very many cards.

不幸的是，我还没有发现SRS在培养有助于洞察的反思性精神状态方面有什么了不起的，除了在我自己学习时故意放慢脚步，比如在散步时。在这样的用例中，SRS不再具有作为其主要卖点的时间效率优势。使用它的机会成本上升了。在全班的SRS课程中，卡片之间长时间的反思性停顿会导致沮丧和行为不当，我们不会通过很多卡片。

In defense of remembering, I will also argue that some skills are simply impossible without a continuous retention of specific dependencies. These skills tend to be technical. Heck, this might be the definition of a technical skill.

为了维护记忆，我还将争辩说，如果没有对特定依赖项的持续保留，某些技能是根本不可能的。这些技能往往是技术性的。见鬼，这可能就是技术技能的定义。

With a few mostly upper-level exceptions, though — math, physics, chemistry — most of what we teach in school is more conceptual than technical. We make you take history so you have a better model of how civilizations and governments work, not so you remember who shot Alexander Hamilton. We make you take English to improve your word-based input and output abilities, not so you remember the difference between *simile* and *metaphor*. At least, I hope we do.[[3\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=arJn7a6Fe56KjriGj#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)

不过，除了少数高水平的例外——数学、物理、化学——我们在学校教的大部分都是概念性的，而不是技术性的。我们让你接受历史，这样你就有了更好的文明和政府运作模式，而不是让你记得是谁枪杀了亚历山大·汉密尔顿。我们让你学英语是为了提高你基于单词的输入和输出能力，不是为了让你记住“明喻”和“隐喻”的区别。至少，我希望我们能做到。[[3\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=arJn7a6Fe56KjriGj#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)

Besides, even in the technical classes, forgetting is the near-universal outcome, and the long-term benefits are mostly conceptual — for if you don’t use these skills continuously for the rest of your life, you’re almost certainly going to lose them. Maybe more than once.

此外，即使是在技术课上，遗忘也是近乎普遍的结果，而长期的益处主要是概念性的——因为如果你在余生中不不断地使用这些技能，你几乎肯定会失去它们。也许不止一次。

I’ve forgotten algebra twice. I’ve forgotten how to write code at least three times. I can’t do either one at the moment. But I’m still changed by having known them. I have an intuition for what sorts of problems ought to be mathematically solvable. I can think in terms of algorithms. And I could relearn either skill more easily than on the first or second occasions. Also, relearning has an anecdotal tendency to deepen understanding in a way that continuous retention may not, especially when approached from a different direction.

我忘记代数两次了。我至少三次忘了怎么写代码。我现在两个都做不了。但我还是因为认识他们而改变了。我有直觉知道什么样的问题应该在数学上解决。我可以用算法来思考。我可以比第一次或第二次更容易地重新学习这两种技能。另外，再学习有一种轶事般的倾向，即以一种不可能持续保持的方式加深理解，特别是当从不同的方向接近时。

Still, as long as I’m defending retention, I think it’s valid to ask whether we should force kids (and often, by extension, their parents) to relearn math every frickin’ year. Consider: The conventional wisdom is that technical companies begrudgingly expect to have to (re)train most new workers in the very specific areas they need. They look to your resume and transcripts mostly for evidence that you have learned technical skills before and can presumably learn them again. I don’t think they care if you’ve re-learned them three times already instead of six. So, if we’re going to force kids to demonstrate intermediate math chops to graduate (a dubious demand), perhaps we could at least wait until the last practical moment, and then do it in bigger continuous lumps — like two-hour daily block classes starting in grade 9 or 10 — so they would have fewer opportunities to forget as they climb the dependency pyramid. Think of the tears we could save (or at least postpone).

不过，只要我是在为保留期辩护，我想问一下我们是否应该强迫孩子们（通常也包括他们的父母）每年重新学习数学是有道理的。考虑一下：传统的观点是，技术公司不情愿地期望在他们需要的特定领域对大多数新员工进行培训。他们看你的简历和成绩单主要是为了证明你以前学过技术技能，大概还能再学。我认为他们不在乎你是否已经学了三次而不是六次。所以，如果我们要强迫孩子们在毕业前展示中级数学技能（这是一个可疑的要求），也许我们至少可以等到最后一个实际的时刻，然后在一个更大的连续的群体中进行，比如从9年级或10年级开始每天两小时的集体课，这样他们在爬上依赖金字塔的时候忘记的机会就更少了。想想我们可以省下的眼泪（或者至少可以推迟）。

## The value proposition of classroom SRS

## 课堂教学的价值主张

Anyway, classroom SRS has its strengths, but midwifing conceptual insights doesn’t feel like one of them. I think it’s also reasonable to assume that students forget almost everything from a classroom SRS deck as soon as they stop using it.

不管怎么说，课堂SRS有它的优势，但助产的概念见解感觉不是其中之一。我认为，假设学生一停止使用教室里的所有东西，几乎都会忘记，这也是合理的。

Adjusting for these two assumptions, the terrain where classroom SRS can beat out its opportunity costs dramatically shrinks. But I believe it still exists, at the intersection of high automaticity targets and medium-term objectives.

考虑到这两个假设，教室SRS能够战胜机会成本的领域急剧缩小。但我相信它仍然存在，在高自动化目标和中期目标的交叉点。

With [*high automaticity targets*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Tiers_of_availability), what you’re trying to train is a reflexive response to a stimulus that is going to look a lot like the study card. Foreign language vocabulary is my poster child for this. You’re not drilling the words to unearth insights. You’re drilling for speed, so that they can keep up when a word pops up in a real-time conversation.

具有[*高自动化目标*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Tiers_of_availability)，你要训练的是一种对刺激的反射性反应，看起来很像学习卡。外语词汇是我的招牌。你不是在钻研词汇来挖掘见解。你在钻研速度，这样他们就可以跟上实时对话中突然出现的一个词。

You’re also trying to drill away the need for conscious awareness. You want that front-side combination of sounds or letters to cause the back-side set of sounds or letters to pop automatically into their heads. This is my intent when I drill my English students in word fragments (prefixes, roots, suffixes), which are really just bits of foreign language (Greek, Latin). If it’s not automatic, then they’ll gloss right over the possible meaning of “salubrious”, even though they have learned that “salu” usually means “health”.

你也在试图钻出有意识意识的需要。你想让前面的声音或字母组合让后面的一组声音或字母自动弹出到他们的脑袋里。这就是我训练我的英语学生学习单词片段（前缀、词根、后缀）的意图，这些片段实际上只是外语的一小部分（希腊语、拉丁语）。如果这不是自动的，那么他们会掩盖“健康”的可能含义，即使他们已经知道“salu”通常意味着“健康”。

By *medium-term objective*, I mean “I want my students to have automatic fluency with the content of these cards on Day X”, where X is a date between one week and three months in the future. It shouldn’t be sooner than that, in accordance with [Gwern’s “5 and 5” rule](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#how-much-to-add): You probably need at least five days to get any real advantage from SRS. And it shouldn’t be later than a few months, for two reasons: First, we’re assuming the students will forget it all once they stop studying, which is all but guaranteed after the end of the course; there’s little point in keeping those cards in rotation after Day X. Second, I probably don’t want to start those cards until the last practical minute, which is unlikely to be more than three months ahead of time.

所谓“中期目标”，我的意思是“我希望我的学生在第X天自动流利地掌握这些卡片的内容”，其中X是未来一周到三个月之间的日期。根据[Gwern的“5和5”法则](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#how-还有很多要补充的）：你可能至少需要五天的时间才能从SRS那里获得真正的优势。而且不应该迟于几个月，原因有二：第一，我们假设学生一旦停止学习就会忘记这一切，这在课程结束后几乎是可以保证的；在第X天之后让这些卡片轮换没有什么意义。第二，我可能不想在最后一刻才开始使用这些卡，这不太可能比实际时间提前三个月以上。

Why three months and not six? It’s not a hard-and-fast rule, but from the experience of my first three years of classroom SRS, if you’re trying to retain things for more than a few months, the total number of cards is likely to become greater than you can productively study every day, and many cards will languish unseen. Plus, your roster can change, especially over a semester break. The set of students you have in six months might only have 70% overlap with the set you have now. Really, you should wait until the last practical minute.

为什么是三个月而不是六个月？这不是一个硬性规定，但根据我在课堂上头三年的经验，如果你想把东西保留几个月以上，卡片的总数很可能会超过你每天能有效学习的数量，很多卡片会在看不见的情况下萎靡不振。另外，你的花名册可能会改变，特别是在一个学期的休息时间。你在六个月内拥有的一组学生可能与你现在拥有的一组学生只有70%的重叠。真的，你应该等到最后一分钟。

But what constitutes a worthy “Day X”? It might be a test. But if it’s *your* test, you may not have been listening. *Your* test may just be arbitrarily punishing some kids for forgetting a little sooner than others. However, if it’s an external test, with high stakes for you and your students, then it could be a worthy Day X indeed. For me, Day X is the day of the big state test — the one used to compare students to students, teachers to teachers, and schools to schools.

但什么才是值得纪念的“X日”？可能是个测试。但如果这是你的测试，你可能没在听*你的*测试可能只是任意惩罚一些孩子，因为他们比其他孩子忘记得早一点。然而，如果这是一个外部测试，对你和你的学生来说风险很大，那么这确实是一个值得的日子。对我来说，第十天是州大考试的日子——用来比较学生和学生，老师和老师，学校和学校。

When your students do well on an external test, though, please keep a healthy perspective. A high test score doesn’t mean they can do the hard things now and forever. It means they were able to earn a high test score on Day X. They will forget almost all of it afterwards. But you will have given them their best chance to signal to others that they can learn hard things, and that you can teach them hard things, and that your school has teachers who can teach hard things.

不过，当你的学生在外部测试中表现出色时，请保持健康的心态。考试分数高并不意味着他们现在就可以做困难的事情，而且永远都可以。这意味着他们能够在第X天获得高分。之后他们几乎会忘记所有的事情。但你会给他们最好的机会，让他们向其他人发出信号，他们可以学习艰苦的东西，你可以教他们艰苦的东西，你的学校有老师可以教艰苦的东西。

Day X doesn’t have to be a test. If you’re optimizing for brain change that persists after they forget all of your content, Day X could be an immersive event. Maybe your Spanish class is going to Madrid. You know they will have a deeper experience if you can bring their vocabulary to a peak of richness and automaticity on the eve of departure. Yes, they’ll still forget almost all the words later. But they might retain a glimpse of how the world looked when seen through another language.

第十天不一定是测试。如果你正在优化他们忘记你的所有内容后仍然存在的大脑变化，那么第X天可能是一个沉浸式的事件。也许你的西班牙语课要去马德里。你知道，如果你能在他们离开的前夕把他们的词汇带到一个丰富和自动的高峰，他们会有更深的体验。是的，他们以后还是会忘记几乎所有的单词。但他们也许能从另一种语言中看到世界的面貌。

Maybe your event is smaller. A virtual trip. An in-class conversation day where we pretend we’re at the beach (“¡En la Playa!”). Maybe their long-term takeaway will be an appreciation for how different languages use different grammars, which is not something most people even consider until they’ve studied a second language. Get their mental gears turning hard enough, and they might even see grammar as an arbitrary construct with tunable parameters and tradeoffs that influence what can be communicated easily. Maybe they’ll independently rediscover the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. But they’re not going to remember how to say ‘sand’. Nope. ‘Shark’, maybe (¡Tiburón!). But you can’t predict this, and it’s probably not worth the effort to try. 

也许你的活动比较小。一次虚拟的旅行。我们假装在海滩上的课堂对话日¡“玩吧！”）。也许他们的长期收获将是对不同语言如何使用不同语法的欣赏，这是大多数人甚至在学习第二语言之前都不会考虑的。让他们的思想齿轮转动足够努力，他们甚至可能认为语法是一个任意的结构与可调参数和权衡，影响什么可以很容易地沟通。也许他们会独立地重新发现萨皮尔-沃尔夫假说。但他们不会记得怎么说“沙子”。“没有。”鲨鱼，也许吧(¡提布尔ó不。但你无法预测这一点，这可能不值得尝试。

But maybe you’re not teaching a foreign language. No matter your subject, Day X could be any conceptually demanding lesson or unit that is difficult to even talk about without fluency in a given set of terms. These aren’t very common in 10th Grade English, though they come up more often in my Creative Writing class. In these cases, however, the dependent terms are conceptually rich enough that they don’t lend themselves very well to cards, and I find it’s better to just quickly re-teach them in front of the lessons that use them. “Remember how we said...”[[4\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=Hu24XAjqEh387qWYa#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA) 

但也许你不是在教外语。不管你的主题是什么，第十天可能是任何概念上要求很高的课程或单元，如果不流利地使用给定的术语，甚至很难谈论。这些在十年级的英语中并不常见，尽管它们在我的创意写作课上出现得更多。然而，在这些情况下，从属术语在概念上足够丰富，它们不能很好地用于卡片，我发现最好是在使用它们的课程之前快速地重新教它们。”还记得我们是怎么说的吗……[[4\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=Hu24XAjqEh387qWYa#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)

## How I currently use classroom SRS

## 我目前如何使用教室SRS

As you may have guessed, I’ve radically scaled back my usage of classroom SRS since those first three years. In fact, for the last four years, I’ve only used it during a two-to-three month span leading up to the state test. And for the last two of *those* years, I’ve only used it for word fragments. I’m very unlikely to abandon its use for word fragments, though, because the most important thing I teach my students by using SRS is [the existence of SRS](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#A_life_changed). Word fragments are my favorite way to demonstrate how efficient study time can be. I add no more than about ten cards per *week*, which means that most days’ study takes less than two minutes. (This is good, because my own enthusiasm now begins to flag by the two minute mark.) I give very short quizzes on the fragments so they can do well on them and see how a little study can have a big payoff. (Remember that most of my students don’t ever study on their own.)

你可能已经猜到了，从最初的三年开始，我已经大幅缩减了课堂SRS的使用量。事实上，在过去的四年里，我只在州考试前的两到三个月内使用过它。在过去的两年里，我只把它用在单词片段上。不过，我不太可能放弃对单词片段的使用，因为我用SRS教我的学生最重要的是（SRS的存在）(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#A_life_changed). 单词片段是我最喜欢的展示学习时间效率的方式。我每周加的卡片不超过十张，这意味着大多数日子的学习时间不到两分钟(这很好，因为我自己的热情现在开始以两分钟为标志。）我对这些片段进行了非常简短的测试，这样他们就可以在这些片段上表现出色，看看一点学习能有多大的回报(请记住，我的大多数学生从来没有自己学习过。）

I’m still using Anki, with different profiles for each class. I run the review in a call-and-response style, where I show and say the card, and they know to simply shout out the answer. On a good day, it becomes a kind of chant. The number, speed, accuracy, and confidence of the responding voices tells me which button to press, and there’s usually a bellwether student I can listen for as I make my decision. Because I’m striving for very high automaticity, I almost always press either 2 (the shortest affirmative next-study delay) or 1 (the negative start-it-from-scratch button).

我仍然在使用Anki，每个类都有不同的配置文件。我以打电话和回复的方式进行评论，我展示并说出卡片，他们知道只需大声说出答案。在一个好日子里，它变成了一种吟唱。反应声音的数量、速度、准确度和信心告诉我该按哪个按钮，在我做决定时，通常有一个领头羊学生我可以听。因为我在努力实现高度的自动化，所以我几乎总是按2（最短的肯定的下次学习延迟）或1（否定的从头开始按钮）。

My students mostly like the call-and-response flow, as archaic as it sounds, and I will refer you to [an older footnote](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#7) about that time I observed a traditional one-room Mennonite schoolhouse:

我的学生们大多喜欢呼叫和响应流程，虽然听起来很古老，但我会让你们参考[一个旧的脚注](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#7)大约在那时，我观察到一个传统的单室门诺派校舍：

> I once had the privilege of observing part of a lesson in a traditional [Mennonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mennonites_in_Mexico) one-room schoolhouse. I don't speak a word of Low German, but it was clear the kids knew whatever it was they were drilling as they stood up and recited together. Most striking was the fact that they were *all* on the same page. There were no stragglers spacing out, slumped over, dozing off. The teacher could confidently build up to whatever came next without fear of leaving anyone behind.

>我曾经有幸在一个传统的[门诺派]中观察了一节课的一部分(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mennonites_in_Mexico)一间教室。我不会说一句低沉的德语，但很明显，孩子们站起来一起背诵时知道他们在练习什么。最引人注目的是他们都在同一页上。没有一个掉队的人站在外面，瘫倒在地，打瞌睡。老师可以自信地为接下来发生的事情而努力，而不必担心丢下任何人。

For at least a minute or two every day, even worldly American kids can enjoy the routine. As I put it elsewhere in that Second Year report, “They enjoy the validation they get with each chance to confirm that they remember something. They enjoy going with the flow of a whole class doing the same thing. They enjoy the respite of learning on rails for a change, without any expectation that they take initiative or parse instructions.”

每天至少有一到两分钟，即使是世俗的美国孩子也能享受这种生活。正如我在第二年报告的其他地方所说，“他们享受着每一次确认自己记得什么的机会所得到的验证。他们喜欢跟着全班同学做同样的事情。他们享受在rails上学习的喘息之机，而不期望自己主动或解析指令。”

It probably goes without saying, but this call-and-response format only works well with cards with a very short answer that can be recalled very quickly. This is why I now only use SRS for word fragments. If I taught a foreign language, or even a lower-grade reading class with more basic vocab words, I would be using it more. My wife taught high school Spanish for a number of years, experimented with SRS, and is on the record as saying [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) deserves to eat the world. Anyone she could get to use it independently didn’t really need her class to do well on the final assessments.

这可能不用说，但这种呼叫和响应格式只适用于回答非常简短、可以很快回忆起来的卡片。这就是为什么我现在只对单词片段使用SRS。如果我教一门外语，甚至是一个低年级的阅读课，有更多的基本词汇，我会用得更多。我妻子在高中教了好几年西班牙语，还做过SRS实验，而且还公开说(https://www.duolingo.com/)值得吃这个世界。任何一个她能独立使用它的人都不需要她的课在期末考试中取得好成绩。

After the state test, my students will forget almost all of their word fragments. That is the way of things. Ashes to ashes, circle of life, or, to get back to my controlling analogy, “All drains lead to the ocean, kid.” What I’m hoping will remain is an updated appreciation for what a little regular study can do, and a vague recollection that there are these apps out there that are, you know, like smart flash cards, that make it *fast* to memorize stuff.

在国家考试之后，我的学生几乎会忘记他们所有的单词片段。事情就是这样。灰烬到灰烬，生命的循环，或者，回到我的控制类比，“所有的排水管通向海洋，孩子。”我希望留下的是一个更新的赞赏什么一点定期研究可以做，和一个模糊的回忆，有这些应用程序在那里，你知道，像智能闪存卡，这使得记忆东西变得很快。

## Against apathy, toward apprenticeship

## 反对冷漠，走向学徒

I’m nearing the end of Part 1, which means I’m nearing the end of my labors on this post, since Part 2 was mostly written five years ago. As writing projects go, I have found this one extraordinarily difficult. Over the course of its creation, I have pooped five times. It wants to be a book (or at least a blog), as everything I say tries to come out as a chapter of explanation having little to do with SRS.[[5\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=hByHqqWgCNtKfbGJ2#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)

我已经接近第1部分的结尾了，这意味着我在这篇文章中的工作已经接近尾声，因为第2部分主要是五年前写的。随着写作项目的进行，我发现这个项目异常困难。在它被创造的过程中，我大便了五次。它想成为一本书（或者至少是一个博客），因为我所说的每一句话都试图成为一个与SRS无关的解释章节。[[5\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=hByHqqWgCNtKfbGJ2#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)

Well, I’m now going to indulge in several paragraphs where I don’t tie it back to SRS, so I can tell you the story of how I reinvented myself after my third year of spaced repetition software in the classroom. This included moving to a new school where I would have greater freedom to pursue my evolving views about learning. For what it’s worth, this story at least *starts* with SRS.

好吧，我现在将沉迷于几个段落，在这里我不把它与SRS联系起来，所以我可以告诉你，在我在教室里使用间隔复读软件的第三年之后，我是如何重塑自己的故事。这包括搬到一所新学校，在那里我将有更大的自由去追求我对学习的不断发展的观点。不管怎样，这个故事至少从SRS开始。

You see, it was during those dangerously long classroom Anki sessions six and seven years ago that I honed my sensitivity to students’ moods, to my own mood, and to how these feed off of each other. Sustaining a session without losing the room was like magnetically confining hot deuterium plasma — dicey, volatile, but occasionally, mysteriously, over unity.[[6\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=r7S83skpFv3go87vy#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA) I came to view anti-apathetic moods as a kind of energy that can be harnessed to do work *and to create new energy*.

你看，正是在六七年前那些危险而漫长的课堂上，我磨练了自己对学生情绪的敏感，对自己情绪的敏感，以及对这些情绪如何相互影响的敏感。在不失去房间的情况下维持一个疗程就像是磁封闭的热氘等离子体-危险的，易变的，但偶尔，神秘的，统一之上。[[6\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=r7S83skpFv3go87vy#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)我开始将反冷漠情绪视为一种能量，可以用来工作*和创造新的能量*。

Apathy, you may recall, is the true enemy. I’ve always known that. I [called her out](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Stuck_in_neutral) five years ago[[7\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=gYX6ThiZvQhEqJxYu#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA), but soon came to realize I had been fighting her on the wrong front.

你可能还记得，冷漠是真正的敌人。我早就知道了。我[叫她出来](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dtCfxYubZgRnEkGpQ/a-second-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Stuck_in_neutral)五年前[[7\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=gYX6ThiZvQhEqJxYu#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)，但很快就意识到我和她打错了战线。

I had been preoccupied by the fact that students who don’t care won't activate enough of their brain to get any benefits from our daily review. To be fair, that *is* a problem, if I’m trying to prime them for success at a Day X event. But the more insidious issue is that a student in the thrall of Apathy won’t be churning their mental gears on any of the content I may have tricked them into learning, which means they’ll just forget it all without having made any lasting changes to their models. That’s not just an Anki-time problem. That’s an all-the-time problem. If they don’t engage with anything, they don’t keep anything.

我一直被这样一个事实困扰着：那些不在乎的学生不会激活他们的大脑，从我们的日常复习中得到任何好处。公平地说，如果我想让他们在第十天的活动中获得成功，那就是一个问题。但更阴险的问题是，一个受冷漠束缚的学生不会在我可能诱使他们学习的任何内容上动脑筋，这意味着他们只会忘记这一切，而不会对自己的模式做任何持久的改变。这不仅仅是安基的时间问题。这一直是个问题。如果他们不参与任何活动，他们就不会保留任何东西。

I set off on a holy quest for anti-apathetic energy.

我开始了对反冷漠能量的神圣追求。

My errantry led me, for a time, to study stand-up comedy, not just because humor creates energy, but because a big part of that craft is an acting trick where you deliver incredibly polished lines in a way that sounds like you’re coming up with them right there in that moment.[[8\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=9f2JZ8BcpdFsq88jM#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA) Perceived spontaneity is a powerful source of energy even more versatile than humor.

有一段时间，我的错误引导我学习单口喜剧，不仅仅因为幽默能创造能量，但因为这门手艺的很大一部分是一种表演技巧，你用一种听起来像是你在那一刻就想到了的方式来表现出令人难以置信的优美线条。[[8\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=9f2JZ8BcpdFsq88jM#fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA)感知到的自发性是一种强大的能量来源，甚至比幽默更多才多艺。

I don’t know if I learned much about scripted spontaneity that I could articulate, but I felt like some of it rubbed off on me just by watching the experts closely over extended periods. And you know what? A lecture isn’t so different from a bit. A lesson isn’t so different from a set. A single changed word, a half-second delay, a subtle shift in facial expression can completely change the way the moment feels to the audience class. And like a comedian workshopping new material on the road, I could use the fact that I might teach the same lesson five times in one day to test variations, trying to provoke more engagement, better questions, bigger laughs.

我不知道我是否学到了很多我能说清楚的脚本式的自发性，但我觉得只要长时间密切观察专家们，其中的一些就对我产生了影响。你知道吗？一次讲座和一次讲座没什么区别。一节课和一套没什么区别。一句话的改变，半秒的延迟，面部表情的微妙变化，都能彻底改变观众对这一时刻的感受。就像一个喜剧演员在路上跳新材料一样，我可以利用我可能在一天内教五次同样的课的事实来测试变化，试图激发更多的参与，更好的问题，更大的笑声。

Equally important: I recognized that the process of refining the performance art was fun for me, and that my own engagement was the most powerful source of classroom energy. I could transmit it to my students, and maybe even get some energy back from them while I directed some of it into activity that would get their mental gears turning. Instead of burning out, I could burn brighter, and longer. On a good day, it became self-sustaining. On a great day, it could go supercritical, sending me home after my last class with my head spinning in a buzz of positive vibes and deep thoughts.[[9\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA#_ftnref9)

同样重要的是：我认识到改进表演艺术的过程对我来说很有趣，我自己的参与是课堂能量的最强大来源。我可以把它传递给我的学生，甚至可以从他们身上获得一些能量，同时我把一些能量引导到活动中，让他们的大脑运转起来。我可以烧得更亮、更久，而不是烧得精疲力尽。在好的一天，它变得自给自足。在一个美好的日子里，它可能会变得超临界，在我上完最后一节课后，我会在积极的氛围和深刻的思想中头晕，然后把我送回家。[[9\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=fPbGJqeaEbtx3GdwA#_ftnref9)

During this same era, as part of my ongoing study of creative writing, I was binge-listening to interviews with television writers. One pattern that struck me was that it wasn’t too uncommon for someone to just kind of find themselves working in that highly rarefied field simply because they had spent a lot of time around others who were already doing it. Without any organized instruction, they picked up on how it worked.

在同一个时代，作为我正在进行的创造性写作研究的一部分，我疯狂地听电视作家的采访。一个让我印象深刻的模式是，一个人发现自己在这个高度稀有的领域工作并不罕见，仅仅因为他们花了很多时间在其他人身边。在没有任何有组织的指导下，他们学会了如何工作。

Did you catch it? That was twice that I had noticed how arcane expertise can rub off on people through prolonged proximity. That got me thinking about the [German Apprenticeship Model](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/why-germany-is-so-much-better-at-training-its-workers/381550/), and its medieval — nay, prehistoric — roots. It’s how we used to learn everything, right? We followed mama out to the berry bushes, and papa out to the hunting grounds. The fact that it seemed to work for television writers told me that apprenticeship wasn’t just for blue collar skills.

你抓到了吗？这是我两次注意到神秘的专业知识如何通过长时间的接近而影响到人们。这让我想到了[德国学徒模式](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/why-germany-is-so-much-better-at-training-its-workers/381550/)以及它的中世纪-不，史前-根源。我们以前都是这样学的，对吧？我们跟着妈妈到了浆果丛，爸爸到了狩猎场。事实上，这似乎是工作的电视作家告诉我，学徒不仅是蓝领技能。

So, with the longer leash I enjoyed under my new bosses, I decided to move my instructional style closer to something resembling an apprenticeship where I mentored groups of 20-30 padawans in my arcane expertise.

因此，随着我在新老板手下所受的束缚越来越长，我决定将我的教学方式向类似学徒制的方式转变，在学徒制中，我用自己的奥术专长指导20-30名学徒。

![img](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/4d7381004d1432f9292ca008a66c2ce85f1b31595188e05d.jpeg)

Yeah, I jumped on a trendy meme. Note my careful word choice: ‘show’, not ‘tell’. This, to me, is the defining action in mentor-apprentice relationships.

是的，我喜欢流行的迷因。请注意，我谨慎地选择了“show”，而不是“tell”。对我来说，这是师徒关系中的决定性行动。

By switching schools, I lost my interactive whiteboard. So I replaced it with something even better: an extra computer on a make-shift stand-up desk (a narrow kitchen prep cart with fold-out boards.). A cheap second-hand monitor could face me while I mirrored that screen to the projector. Now I could do what I had seen coders do at instructional meet-ups: face the class while typing.

由于转学，我失去了互动白板。所以我用更好的东西代替了它：在临时搭建的桌子上多放了一台电脑（一个狭窄的带折叠板的厨房准备车）。当我把屏幕镜像到投影仪上时，一个便宜的二手显示器可以对着我。现在我可以像我在教学会议上看到的那样：一边打字一边面对课堂。

This meant I could *show* students what I do as a writer in real time, thinking out loud and watching their reactions as I typed. This could easily bore them, of course, but with strong energy-fu, old-school touch typing speed, and face-to-face interaction, I can pull it off more often than you might expect. On a good day, they find it fascinating. On one very special occasion each year, I do it for the full period, writing a 400+ word essay from scratch in 40 minutes with no prior knowledge of the prompt. Students have to hold their questions that day, and instead take observation notes, which become fodder for an extended debriefing discussion the next day.

这意味着我可以实时向学生展示我作为一名作家所做的事情，大声思考，并在打字时观察他们的反应。当然，这很容易让他们感到厌烦，但有了强大的精力、老式的触摸打字速度和面对面的互动，我可以比你想象的更经常地完成它。天气好的时候，他们会觉得很迷人。每年有一个非常特殊的场合，我都会做一整篇文章，在40分钟内白手起家地写一篇400多字的文章，事先不知道提示。学生们必须在当天保留他们的问题，而是记下观察笔记，这些笔记将成为第二天长时间汇报讨论的素材。

The most important thing I’ve learned from those debriefings is that everyone can pick up something from a holistic demonstration like that, regardless of their skill level.[[10\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=2dRT2RZ7yJSfGQvZn#_ftnref9) An advanced student might ask about my bracket substitution of a pronoun in a quote. An average student might say, “You used a lot of small and medium-sized body paragraphs instead of three big ones.” A sub-level student might say, “You didn’t like it if you used the same word too soon after you used it before.” And I always seem to get at least one surprising question about something I never would have thought to teach them, like, “How did you suck words into your cursor?” Then I’m like, “Oh, let me show you the difference between the Backspace and Delete keys…”

我从这些汇报中学到的最重要的一点是，每个人都可以从这样的整体演示中得到一些东西，不管他们的技能水平如何。[[10\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6ZTtBXn2cFLmWPdM/?commentId=2dRT2RZ7yJSfGQvZn#_ftnref9)一个高年级的学生可能会问关于我用括号代替引号中的代词的问题。一个普通的学生可能会说，“你用了很多中小型的正文段落，而不是三个大的。”一个低年级的学生可能会说，“你不喜欢在使用同一个词之后过早地使用它。”我似乎总是会遇到一个令人惊讶的问题，关于一些我从未想过要教给他们的东西，比如，“你是怎么把词吸进光标的？”然后我会说，“哦，我来告诉你退格键和删除键之间的区别……”

Did I make them memorize anything with that “lesson”? Nah. Did they make lasting updates to their mental models? Probably! Are you thinking of asking me, “But how do you test them on it?” Because if you are, then you *really* haven’t been paying attention!

我让他们记住了什么“教训”？不。他们是否对自己的心智模型进行了持久的更新？可能！你是不是想问我，“但是你怎么测试它们呢？”因为如果你是的话，那么你真的没有注意到！

There’s plenty more to be said about apprenticeship, but I think you get the idea, and this is still nominally an essay about classroom SRS.

关于学徒制还有很多要说的，但我想你明白了，这篇文章名义上仍然是一篇关于课堂教学的文章。

If I had to summarize my self-reinvention in too many words, I would say that I’m now optimizing for “good days” at the high-energy intersection of “engaging for me”, “engaging for them”, and “conducive to lasting and worthwhile updates to their mental models”, with less regard for curricular scope and sequence.

如果我不得不用太多的话来总结我的自我重塑，我会说，我现在在“为我投入”、“为他们投入”和“有助于对他们的心智模式进行持久而有价值的更新”的高能量交叉点上优化“好日子”，而较少考虑课程范围和顺序。

In practice, this means… well, a lot of things. But it’s time I pinch off Part 1. That, “or get off the pot,” as they say.

实际上，这意味着…嗯，很多事情。但现在是我删掉第一部分的时候了。他们说，“或者滚开。”。

# Part 2: A Third Year of Spaced Repetition Software in the Classroom (2017)

## Synopsis and disclosure

## 概要和披露

I tried the obvious thing this year. Instead of game show-style whole-class front-of-the-room [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), I arranged for every student to be able to independently study material I created in [Cerego](https://www.cerego.com/), both in and out of class.

今年我尝试了显而易见的事情。而不是游戏表演式的教室前面的全班同学[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)，我安排每个学生都能独立学习我在[Cerego]中创作的材料(https://www.cerego.com/)，课内外。

Disclosure: Cerego provided me a free license for the year in exchange for some detailed feedback, which I gave them. This feedback was mostly about user interface issues and reports, the latter of which required some ugly scripting on my end to get numbers I found useful. As the Cerego team seemed to be rapidly iterating, I imagine they have made many changes and improvements to their app since 2017, though I have not used it since. Please keep this in mind as you read these years-old notes.]

披露：Cerego为我提供了今年的免费许可证，作为交换，我给了他们一些详细的反馈。这个反馈主要是关于用户界面问题和报告，后者需要一些丑陋的脚本才能得到有用的数据。由于Cerego团队似乎在快速迭代，我想他们自2017年以来对自己的应用程序进行了许多更改和改进，尽管从那时起我就没有使用过它。请在阅读这些年头的笔记时牢记这一点。]

Despite many small hang-ups, I was pleased with the Cerego’s features and reliability. In exchange for a great deal of up-front effort, it gave me a unique window into student engagement and progress. Consequently, it proved to be an overwhelmingly potent tool for winning “the blame game”, although I eventually came to feel uneasy about using this power.

尽管有很多小问题，我还是对Cerego的特性和可靠性感到满意。作为前期大量努力的交换，它给了我一个了解学生参与和进步的独特窗口。因此，它被证明是一个压倒性的强有力的工具赢得“责备游戏”，虽然我最终感到不安，使用这种权力。

Longer-term learning outcomes seemed, on average, to be slightly worse than with the whole-class Anki method. While highly motivated students benefited from being able to study more aggressively and efficiently than before -- and their objective scores were higher than ever -- their learning seemed less transferable to more authentic contexts. Students of lower motivation, while seeming to get little from either approach, got even less from this digital 1:1 method, and their slump accounts for the overall decline.

平均而言，较长期的学习结果似乎比全班的Anki方法略差。虽然积极性很高的学生能够比以前更积极、更有效率地学习，而且他们的客观分数比以往任何时候都高，但他们的学习似乎不太适合更真实的环境。动机较低的学生，虽然似乎从这两种方法中得到的很少，但从这种数字1:1的方法中得到的更少，他们的不景气导致了整体的下降。

## Setup

## 设置

I taught a mix of regular (not honors) 9th and 10th English classes again, but over the summer of 2016 I was invited to move my classroom into an unusually-spacious converted computer lab in which 16 older desktop PCs were kindly left at my request. I had these arranged facing the sides of the room so I could see all screens easily. I allocated those PC seats on a semi-permanent basis as needed and requested. The balance of students sat at normal desks and used their phones for study.

我又教了第九和第十节英语（不是优等生），但在2016年夏天，我被邀请将教室搬到一个非常宽敞的改装计算机实验室，在我的要求下，16台老式台式电脑被好心地留在了这里。我把这些东西放在房间的两边，这样我就可以很容易地看到所有的屏幕。我根据需要和要求半永久性地分配了这些PC席位。其余的学生坐在正常的课桌上，用手机学习。

This came with challenges. School WiFi was officially off-limits to students (though many always had the password anyway), and many students said they were at the whim of data caps they regularly pushed up against. Their phones, in most cases, were a generation or three behind state-of-the-art, with degraded batteries and exhausted storage capacity. A few students had difficulty even making room for the Cerego app that first week.

这带来了挑战。学校WiFi正式禁止学生使用（尽管很多人都有密码），许多学生表示，他们是一时兴起的数据上限，他们经常推。他们的手机在大多数情况下都落后于最先进水平一两代，电池退化，存储能力耗尽。在第一周，一些学生甚至很难为Cerego应用程序腾出空间。

While our setup was marginal, between the PCs and phones, we only rarely ran into a situation where not everyone could be studying at the same time.

虽然我们的设置是边缘的，在个人电脑和手机之间，我们只是很少遇到一种情况，不是每个人都可以在同一时间学习。

On the software side, it must be said that, for all its features, Cerego wasn’t designed for my specific use case. The company’s featured customers are business and colleges, who use the product as part of packaged training programs and distance learning courses. Importantly, the app favors adding content into the learner’s study rotation in blocks, *on the learner’s own schedule*, rather than making it on the fly and trickling it immediately. It was also not designed to give a teacher “panopticon”-style real-time monitoring, nor to thwart adversarial users who want to look studious without studying.

在软件方面，必须指出的是，Cerego的所有特性都不是为我的特定用例而设计的。该公司的主要客户是企业和大学，他们将该产品作为一揽子培训计划和远程学习课程的一部分。重要的是，该应用程序倾向于在学习者的学习轮换中添加内容，而不是在学习者自己的时间表上，而不是在学习过程中即时地进行。它的设计也不是为了给教师“panopticon”式的实时监控，也不是为了挫败那些想要看起来勤奋而不学习的敌对用户。

## Procedure

## 程序

Before the start of each school day, I would consider the previous day’s lesson content and add to the relevant Cerego study sets as appropriate. This process could be lumpy and not necessarily daily; some lessons invited a great deal of suitable content, and others none at all. Content additions were also far more common first semester than second semester, as I intentionally front-loaded material to maximize the time we would have to reinforce and apply it. During an average week where I added cards, we probably averaged about 50 additions. [ ***!*** ]

在每节课开始之前，我会考虑前一天的课程内容，并根据情况添加到相关的Cerego学习集中。这个过程可能是不稳定的，不一定每天都有；有些课程需要大量合适的内容，而另一些则一点也没有。第一学期的内容添加也比第二学期要普遍得多，因为我有意提前加载材料，以最大限度地延长我们强化和应用这些内容的时间。在我加牌的平均一周里，我们大概平均加了50张牌。[***！***]

With a prominent timer at the front of the room, I allocated 10-12 minutes at the start of every 57 min class period as specially designated “Cerego Time”. During Cerego Time, I would periodically patrol the room to ensure students were on task and to provide support.

在教室前面有一个突出的计时器，我在每57分钟上课开始时分配10-12分钟作为特别指定的“Cerego时间”。在塞雷戈期间，我会定期巡视教室，确保学生们都在执行任务，并提供支持。

Students were allowed to read a pleasure-reading book during this time instead, if they chose. This allowance was most obviously meant for anyone with extra time after catching up with their study, but I wasn’t about to interfere with any teenager reading a book on their own volition. Not all regular readers (2-5 per class) were conscientious Cerego-ers.

如果学生愿意的话，他们可以在这段时间内阅读一本快乐读物。很明显，这项津贴是为那些在补习后有额外时间的人准备的，但我不会干涉任何一个青少年自愿读书。并不是所有的普通读者（每班2-5人）都是认真的礼仪员。

Students were strongly encouraged to also use Cerego outside of class whenever the app recommended, if they wanted maximal retention for minimal time spent.

强烈鼓励学生在课外使用Cerego应用程序，如果他们希望用最少的时间保持最大的记忆。

About once a week, usually without warning, I would give a ten question multiple choice quiz that could include questions directly taken from any content that had been in Cerego for at least a week, no matter how old. This was a multiple choice quiz done digitally in [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas). Before I put the grade into my book, I would add a 10% adjustment (not to exceed 100%), respecting the wisdom that aggressive study sees diminishing returns as one approaches a goal of 100% retention on large bodies of knowledge. My students were aware of this free 10% and my reasoning behind it.

大约一周一次，通常是在没有任何警告的情况下，我会做一个十个问题的多项选择测验，其中可以包括直接从Cerego上至少一周的任何内容中抽取的问题，不管这些内容有多老。这是一个在[Canvas]中进行的数字选择题测验(https://www.instructure.com/canvas). 在我把分数写进我的书之前，我会加上10%的调整（不超过100%），尊重这样一种智慧：积极的研究认为，当一个人接近100%保留大量知识的目标时，回报会减少。我的学生意识到了这10%的免费以及我的理由。

To account for students just joining my class at the start of second semester, and for those who inevitably studied nothing for the seventeen calendar days between semesters — and even for those simply desperate for a fresh start — I had a lengthy grace period of sorts in January and February. Older stuff was temporarily not included in the “quizzable” question pool. I posted dates for when I would consider each old set fair game again; every week or two, a set would find itself back in the pool according to this schedule, and stay there for the rest of the year.

考虑到刚在第二学期开始时加入我的班的学生，以及那些不可避免地在学期之间的17个日历日里什么也没学的学生——甚至是那些渴望重新开始的学生——我在1月和2月有一个相当长的宽限期。旧的东西暂时不包括在“问答”题库中。我公布了重新考虑每场旧式比赛的日期；每隔一两周，一组人就会按照这个时间表回到游泳池里，并在那里呆上一年。

I did not use Cerego stats directly for any kind of grade, instead using my Canvas quizzes for this. My reasons:

我没有直接用Cerego的数据来评分，而是用我的画布测验来评分。我的理由：

- I wasn’t sure every student would consistently be able to use the app, and didn’t want to deal with the push-back from students and parents claiming (honestly or otherwise) insurmountable tech obstacles to using Cerego outside of class.

-我不确定每个学生都能一直使用这个应用程序，也不想面对学生和家长的强烈反对，他们声称（诚实地或以其他方式）在课外使用Cerego存在无法克服的技术障碍。

- Due to limitations in Cerego’s reporting, I wasn’t sure how to regularly compute a fair grade based on Cerego stats.

-由于Cerego报告的局限性，我不确定如何根据Cerego的统计数据定期计算公平分数。

- I wasn’t sure how far I would be able to trust that a student’s stats weren’t being run up by a smarter friend using the app on their behalf.

-我不知道我能相信一个学生的数据不会被一个更聪明的朋友代表他们使用这个应用程序。

- I didn’t want to discourage students from using Cerego Time to instead read their pleasure books (a habit of immense, scientifically-backed value that I do everything I can to promote).

-我不想阻止学生们利用塞雷戈的时间来阅读他们的快乐读物（这是一个有着巨大科学价值的习惯，我尽我所能去促进它）。

- I didn’t want to give the impression that Cerego is necessarily the best or only way to study, but instead to make it clear that knowing the content was *their* responsibility, however they chose to do it; my providing them with Cerego cards and time to study them was simply a function of my being a Really Nice Guy.

-我不想给人这样一种印象，认为Cerego必然是学习的最好或唯一的方式，而是想明确地表明，了解内容是他们的责任，不管他们选择做什么；我给他们提供了Cerego卡片和时间来研究它们，这仅仅是因为我是一个非常好的人。

## Points of friction

## 摩擦点

This section is not a critique of Cerego specifically, but rather a reminder that classroom technology is not inherently good. The mythical 1:1 student tech ratio doesn’t suddenly make impossible dreams reality, and in fact comes with ongoing costs that must be weighed against the benefits. Here were some points of friction I encountered:

这一节并不是对Cerego的具体批评，而是提醒人们课堂技术并非天生的好。神话般的1:1的学生技术比例并不会突然让不可能的梦想成真，事实上，伴随着持续的成本，必须与收益进行权衡。以下是我遇到的一些摩擦点：

- Forgotten login information for the school PCs or Cerego.

-忘记了学校PC或Cerego的登录信息。

- Slow startup, login, and load times on outdated equipment. [Fun fact: I’ve found that as my current school cuts down on the need for different logins through [Clever](https://clever.com/), they create a separate problem of longer and more fragile authentication chains — handshaking from one site to another — that can fail on slow machines or under spotty WiFi.]

-过时设备的启动、登录和加载时间缓慢[有趣的事实：我发现随着我现在的学校减少了通过[聪明]登录不同网站的需要(https://clever.com/)，它们产生了一个单独的问题，即更长、更脆弱的身份验证链（从一个站点到另一个站点的握手）在速度较慢的机器上或在杂乱无章的WiFi下可能会失败。]

- Old or abused keyboards and mice that intermittently fail.

-旧的或被滥用的键盘和鼠标间歇性地失灵。

- The occasional bigger problem, like a blown power supply.

-偶尔会出现更大的问题，比如电力供应中断。

- For phone users: discharged, confiscated, lost, or broken devices.

-适用于手机用户：放电、没收、丢失或损坏的设备。

- Distractions and inappropriate behaviors that wouldn’t be possible if students didn’t have their own screen to command.

-如果学生没有自己的屏幕来指挥，就不可能出现分心和不适当的行为。

All of the above adds up to a kind of tax on your time and energy, even when you have enough respect from your students to minimize deliberate abuse. (I had maybe 2-3 bad eggs during the year committing occasional acts of minor sabotage.) Moreover, every possible point of friction becomes amplified by a student who doesn’t feel getting to the objective, like a child who finds an hour’s worth of [yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) to do whenever bedtime rolls around.

所有这些加起来就是对你的时间和精力的一种征税，即使你从学生那里得到足够的尊重，尽量减少故意的虐待(在这一年里，我可能有2-3个坏鸡蛋，偶尔会有一些小破坏行为。）此外，每一个可能的摩擦点都会被一个感觉不到目标的学生放大，就像一个发现了一个小时价值的[牦牛剃须]的孩子(https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving)睡觉时间一到就做。

## Problems with multiple-choice study cards

## 多项选择学习卡的问题

Unlike Anki and other personal-use SRS, where the user self-assesses performance and collaborates with the app to schedule the next review, apps like Cerego are built to measure retention objectively. This changes how study cards have to be constructed. Although options [even in 2017] are varied, the most practical and straightforward method is usually a “front” side card with a question or term and a “back” side of multiple-choice responses.

与Anki和其他个人使用SRS不同的是，用户可以自我评估性能，并与应用程序协作安排下一次审查，像Cerego这样的应用程序是为了客观地衡量保留率。这改变了学习卡的构造方式。尽管（即使是在2017年）选项多种多样，但最实用和最直接的方法通常是一张“正面”的卡片，上面有一个问题或术语，以及多项选择回答的“背面”。

Some problems with multiple-choice format:

多项选择格式的一些问题：

- Responding to a multiple-choice question (or any kind of question) takes more time than pressing a self-assessment button.

-回答多项选择题（或任何类型的问题）比按自我评估按钮花费更多的时间。

- In general, it’s more work to create study cards that can be assessed by the app. This is true even in the ideal case, which for Cerego is when you can assign a set of cards where the correct answer in one card can automatically become a multiple-choice distractor (wrong answer) for other cards in the set. But many cases are not ideal, and the only plausible distractors will be ones you add manually.

-一般来说，创建可以通过应用程序评估的学习卡需要更多的工作。即使在理想情况下也是如此，对于Cerego来说，你可以分配一组卡片，其中一张卡片上的正确答案会自动成为该组其他卡片的多选分心（错误答案）。但很多情况并不理想，唯一合理的干扰因素是你手动添加的。

- Students can get confused when distractors contaminate tenuous mental associations. This is a well-studied effect with testing in general, and I had one student (motivated, but lower IQ) who I feel was positively ruined by it this year.

-当分心物污染了脆弱的心理联想时，学生会感到困惑。这是一个研究得很好的测试效果，我有一个学生（积极，但智商较低），我觉得今年肯定被它毁了。

- Students mostly don’t try to recall the answer before looking at multiple-choice options, instead defaulting to the following heuristic: “Look for an answer that feels right -- if none do, press ‘None of the above’”. This is a problem, because the act of trying to recall the specific thing is known to be the critical step that reinforces the memory; in contrast, merely recognizing familiar facts (as when “going over notes”) is known to give students false confidence.

-学生在选择多项选项之前，通常不会试图回忆答案，而是默认采用以下启发式方法：“寻找一个感觉正确的答案——如果没有，请按‘以上都没有’。”。这是一个问题，因为试图回忆特定事物的行为是增强记忆的关键步骤；相反，仅仅认识熟悉的事实（比如“复习笔记”）会给学生错误的信心。

I gave my Cerego contacts some ideas I had for minimizing some of the downsides of multiple-choice. Because my students were largely deaf to my pleading that the “front” card screen — the one containing only the question — is where the learning actually happens, there could be a mandatory (or at least default, opt-out) short delay on that screen, especially when the app detects inhumanly rapid clicking. 

我给了我的Cerego联系人一些想法，以尽量减少选择题的缺点。因为我的学生对我的辩解基本上是充耳不闻的，“前”卡屏幕-一个只包含问题-是学习实际发生的地方，有可能是一个强制性的（或至少默认，选择退出）屏幕上的短暂延迟，特别是当应用程序检测到非人道的快速点击。

Cerego actually asks “Do you know this?” on that screen, giving them a chance to self-assess in the negative without going to the multiple choices, but the vast majority of students never saw this screen as anything but a speed bump to click through.

塞雷戈实际上在屏幕上问“你知道吗？”，给了他们一个机会在否定中自我评估，而不去做多项选择，但绝大多数学生从来没有把这个屏幕看作是一个可以点击的减速带。

My thought was that Cerego could occasionally not show the multiple choice options right away when they click “I Know It”, but instead call their bluff, asking, “Oh? How confident are you?” and prompting them to select a confidence level on a slider bar before showing the choices. Not only might this end the bad habit, it could also provide an opportunity to help them with their [credence calibration](http://acritch.com/credence-game/), a useful skill that might make them better thinkers and learners. I also suggested Cerego might be able to use this data to learn more about a learner and better judge their mastery level through sexy Bayesian wizardry.

我的想法是，当他们点击“我知道”时，Cerego有时不能马上显示多项选择选项，而是虚张声势地问：“哦？你有多自信？”并提示他们在显示选择之前在滑条上选择一个信心级别。这不仅可以结束这个坏习惯，还可以提供一个机会帮助他们进行[信任校准](http://acritch.com/credence-game/)，这是一种有用的技能，可以使他们成为更好的思考者和学习者。我还建议Cerego可以利用这些数据来更多地了解学习者，并通过性感的贝叶斯魔法来更好地判断他们的掌握程度。

[My aborted app design would have taken that concept to its logical conclusion: letting trusted users fully self-assess most of the time, but occasionally performing “reality checks” where it made the user respond in a way it could verify. It could then use straightforward Bayesian updates from these checks to decide how often to do them for each user.]

[我流产的应用程序设计会把这个概念带到它的逻辑结论：让受信任的用户在大多数时间完全自我评估，但偶尔执行“现实检查”，让用户以一种可以验证的方式作出回应。然后，它可以使用来自这些检查的直接贝叶斯更新来决定为每个用户执行检查的频率。]

## New failure modes

## 新的失效模式

New format, new failure modes:

新格式、新故障模式：

- **Performative clicking**. I would commonly have students who didn’t want the discomfort of getting called to task, but also didn't want to actually do the task, so they would put up a show of productivity, continually clicking random answers over and over again without reading. Others would loiter in the stats screens, play with the cursor, check their grades... anything that wouldn’t require actual thinking.

-**执行单击**。我通常会让学生们不想因为被要求去做任务而感到不适，但也不想真正去做任务，所以他们会展示出他们的工作效率，不看就不停地点击随机答案。其他人会在统计屏幕上闲逛，玩光标，检查成绩。。。任何不需要实际思考的东西。

- **Exploits**. Some students realized that mindless clicking moved Cerego’s progress bar on their study session forward. In some cases, it even raised their score. One enterprising young man demonstrated this for me, proudly resting a textbook over the Enter key, then kicking back as he “studied” his sets in record time. It was hard to be mad at him, as I could see myself doing the same at his age. Indeed, I was impressed. But he was in no way discouraged by my reminder that I didn’t use Cerego reports for grades, and that his trick wouldn’t leave him any better prepared for the quizzes that counted. (His mind was a steel trap, though; he did just fine.)

-**漏洞**。一些学生意识到，无意识的点击使他们的学习进度条向前移动。在某些情况下，这甚至提高了他们的分数。一个有进取心的年轻人向我展示了这一点，他自豪地把课本放在回车键上，然后在创纪录的时间里“学习”自己的台词。很难对他发火，因为我可以看到自己在他这个年纪也这么做。的确，我印象深刻。但我提醒他，我没有用塞雷戈报告来衡量成绩，他的伎俩也不会让他为重要的测验做更好的准备，他一点也不气馁(不过，他的思想是一个钢铁陷阱；他做得很好。）

- **Hunkering**. Cerego is set up such that students don’t have new cards added to their rotations until they make an active choice to press a button that does this. Thus, many students would endlessly study only the first twenty cards from the start of the year, never pushing themselves with anything new. In their defense, one of my feedback notes to Cerego was that the UI [in 2017, remember] didn’t make it very clear that they had new material awaiting activation. But even after interventions where I walked them through the process, many of these fox-holed students would fail to activate newer cards on their own initiative.

-**驼背**。Cerego的设置是这样的，在学生主动选择按下一个按钮之前，他们不会在轮换中添加新的卡片。因此，许多学生从一开始就没完没了地只学习前二十张卡片，从不强迫自己做任何新的事情。在他们的辩护中，我给Cerego的一个反馈说明是，UI（2017年，记住）没有很清楚地表明他们有新材料等待激活。但即使在我引导他们完成这一过程的干预措施之后，这些躲猫猫的学生中的许多人也无法主动激活新卡。

- **Idleness and moping**. Apathy often manifests as lethargy combined with half-hearted complaints, voiced only when confronted, that it’s “too hard” or that “I don’t understand it”. Even though neither of those complaints made much sense when studying limited subsets of word-definition vocab pairs (the most common card set), I still heard both of them regularly from the hibernating bears I dared to poke. (Metaphorically. Never touch students.)

-**懒惰和闷闷不乐**。冷漠通常表现为无精打采，三心二意的抱怨，只有在面对时才会说“太难了”或“我不明白”。尽管在研究单词定义vocab对（最常见的卡片集）的有限子集时，这两种抱怨都没有多大意义，但我仍然经常从我敢戳的冬眠熊那里听到这两种抱怨(打个比方。千万不要碰学生。）

  This was further evidence of something I already believed: that these complaints, in these contexts, are a means of disincentivizing teachers from bothering them, as opposed to cries for help. After all, if such a student stands by their claim of not understanding it, what is a responsible teacher supposed to do except to stand there and reteach them the whole thing, or schedule one-on-one tutoring, holding their hand with every “I don’t get it” until the work is done for them? If the student had really wanted to understand and do the work, they would have raised their hand as soon as they encountered difficulty instead of trying to be inconspicuous.

这进一步证明了我已经相信的一件事：在这种情况下，这些抱怨是阻止老师打扰他们的一种手段，而不是呼救。毕竟，如果这样一个学生坚持自己不懂的说法，那么一个负责任的老师除了站在那里把整件事都复述给他们听，或者安排一对一的辅导，用每一句“我不懂”牵着他们的手，直到他们的作业完成，还能做什么呢？如果学生真的想理解和做作业，他们会在遇到困难时立即举手，而不是试图不引人注意。

  [I’ve always been more sympathetic to apathetic students than I probably sound here. Public education demands more directed attention from teenagers than most of them can realistically muster for 35 hours a week.]

[我对冷漠的学生总是比我在这里听起来更同情。公共教育要求青少年给予更多的直接关注，而不是他们中的大多数人一周35个小时所能得到的。]

## Dominating the blame game

## 主导着指责游戏

Teachers are regularly asked by their bosses how they are “differentiating” instruction, adjusting lessons for students across a class’s range of skill levels, learning disabilities, and language deficiencies. They are also asked by parents what their children can do to improve their grade.

他们的老板经常问老师，他们是如何“区分”教学的，如何在一个班级的技能水平、学习障碍和语言缺陷范围内为学生调整课程。家长也会问他们，孩子能做些什么来提高成绩。

Cerego gave me a ready answer to both questions: “Well, in my class we use a free study app that I load with all of the terms, vocab and such that could be on my quizzes. It’s like smart flash cards that let you know when you need to study to avoid forgetting things. They adjust to give you more practice with the things you struggle with. Not only do I provide time to use it during class — even providing a computer if they need it — but it works on any internet device. Students can use it as often they like to be as prepared as they want to be.” Nobody ever complained about this answer, and some were quite impressed with it — more than I was, to be honest.

Cerego对这两个问题都给了我一个现成的答案：“好吧，在我的课堂上，我们使用了一个免费的学习应用程序，我加载了所有的词汇，vocab之类的，可能会出现在我的测验中。它就像智能闪存卡，让你知道什么时候你需要学习，以避免忘记的东西。他们调整给你更多的实践与你挣扎的事情。我不仅在课堂上提供时间使用它——甚至在他们需要的时候提供一台电脑——而且它在任何互联网设备上都能工作。学生们可以随心所欲地使用它，随时做好准备。”从来没有人抱怨过这个答案，有些人对此印象深刻——老实说，比我更深刻。

I also had powerful ammunition in the all-too-common scenario where, at a meeting with all of the child’s teachers, a parent blames poor grades on the teachers’ not adjusting to their child’s very special needs, instead of on their child’s ridiculously obvious laziness.

在一个非常普遍的场景中，我也有强大的弹药，在与孩子的所有老师的一次会议上，一位家长将成绩差归咎于老师没有适应孩子的特殊需要，而不是他们孩子可笑的明显懒惰。

We can’t, of course, just come out and call it like we see it. But we *can* show parents our data and let them connect the dots. So, in these cases, I would just repeat my “Well, in *my* class we use a free study app…” spiel, emphasizing the “as prepared as they want to be” part. I would then add, “According to the app, your child has spent [x] minutes studying over the last week, which is about [y]% of the time my average ‘A’ student spent in that same period, and, come to think of it,” I would say, scratching my head for effect, “far less than the time I provide *in class* for it.”

当然，我们不能像我们看到的那样就出来说出来。但我们可以给父母看我们的数据，让他们把这些点联系起来。所以，在这种情况下，我会重复我的“好吧，在我的课堂上，我们使用一个免费的学习应用程序…”斯皮尔，强调“他们想做什么就做什么”的部分。然后我会补充说，“根据这个应用程序，你的孩子在上周花了[x]分钟学习，这大约是同期我的‘A’学生平均花费时间的[y]%，仔细想想，”我挠头说，“远远少于我在课堂上提供的时间。”

Cue evil gaze from parent to child, squirming discomfort from child, envious awe from my fellow teachers.

父母对孩子邪恶的凝视，孩子不安的蠕动，老师们羡慕的敬畏。

It’s true! Here is a snapshot of one type of output I collected from my report-processing scripts for one of my students. You’re looking at one block of a larger data sheet I brought to parent meetings and included in periodic emails sent home. This one was for a fairly average student who put in the minimum expected time but didn’t push themselves very hard. A  slacker's would be more brutal.

是真的！下面是我从一个学生的报告处理脚本中收集的一种输出的快照。你看到的是我在家长会上带来的一份较大的数据表的一部分，它包含在定期寄回家的电子邮件中。这是为一个相当普通的学生谁把在最短的预期时间，但没有推动自己非常努力。懒汉的生活会更残酷。

Like I said, absolute dominance.

就像我说的，绝对优势。

But like a lot of games, beating the “blame game” just made me tired of playing it, and ready to move on to something else. The enemy is not the apathetic student. The enemy is Apathy herself. I want to teach the lazy student, not destroy them with my Orwellian gaze.

但就像很多游戏一样，打败“责怪游戏”只会让我厌倦玩它，并准备去做别的事情。敌人不是冷漠的学生。敌人就是冷漠。我想教导懒惰的学生，而不是用我奥威尔式的目光毁灭他们。

## Results and discussion

## 结果与讨论

### Table

### 表

In the following table, n=129, the sum of the 9th and 10th grade students that finished second semester with me. The procedures were identical in both grades, and I didn’t find much reason to divide them, preferring the larger total sample. I then divided the combined sample into quintiles as shown:

在下表中，n=129，和我一起完成第二学期的九年级和十年级学生的总和。两个年级的程序都是一样的，我没有找到太多的理由来划分他们，我更喜欢较大的总样本。然后我将合并的样本分成五等分，如图所示：

![img](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/d5ff2eecf6dd8ad3687f5a6093b3f5e7464facdf4aad7fd5.png)

The "Sem 2 Grade" is their course grade from just the second semester, but the other stats are all cumulative for the year. (No, I don’t have any state test data for this group, and I never will. Having switched employers, I am not privy to the results, which arrive in late summer or early fall.)

“Sem 2年级”是他们第二学期的课程成绩，但其他数据都是全年累计的(不，我没有这个组的任何状态测试数据，我永远也不会。换了雇主后，我并不知道结果会在夏末或初秋出现。）

“Set Level” is Cerego’s signature rating of overall progress and retention, on a 4-point scale.

“设定水平”是Cerego对总体进度和保留率的标志性评分，采用4分制。

“% of Cards Started” is the fraction of the total cards I had prepared that the students had added into their rotations. (Remember that Cerego did not do this automatically). For 9th graders, there were 648 cards. For 10th grade, there were 749. 

%的卡片开始“是我准备的卡片总数的一部分，学生已经加入到他们的轮换中(记住，塞雷戈并不是自动做到这一点的）。九年级学生有648张卡片。十年级有749人。

### Study time analysis

### 学习时间分析

As a sanity check, I crudely estimate that we had study time on 160 of our 180 school days, spending an average of 11 minutes each time. That would add up to 29.3 hours of total in-class study time. That the actual averages are lower does not surprise me, due to a combination of absences, roster changes, and start-up times. What we can conclusively say is that there was not a massive amount of outside-of-class study going on.

作为一个理智的检查，我粗略地估计，我们在180个教学日中有160天有学习时间，平均每次花11分钟。加起来总共有29.3小时的课堂学习时间。由于缺勤、名册变动和开办时间的综合影响，实际平均数较低并不让我感到惊讶。我们可以肯定地说，没有大量的课外学习在进行。

Of course, not all of those logged study minutes were productive study time. It wasn’t always clear to me when Cerego counted a minute towards study vs. idle, or whether it detected idleness at all on the mobile app. Indeed, there were several cases where a student’s mobile app seemed to have logged continual study overnight, and even, in one case, for multiple continuous days. The above chart has not been adjusted for known or unknown anomalies of this kind.

当然，并非所有记录的学习时间都是富有成效的学习时间。我并不总是清楚Cerego是什么时候开始学习的，还是空闲的，或者它是否在移动应用程序上发现了空闲。事实上，有几次学生的移动应用程序似乎在一夜之间记录了连续学习，甚至有一次记录了连续多天的学习。上述图表并未针对此类已知或未知异常进行调整。

Regardless, as you can see, while time spent studying was correlated with performance, there was barely a 25% difference in study time separating the top and bottom grade quintiles. Even this is less exciting than it looks, as the lowest scorers were also more likely to be absent, missing their in-class study time. I have made no effort to adjust for this.

不管怎样，正如你所看到的，虽然学习时间与成绩相关，但在学习时间上，高年级和低年级的五分位数之间几乎没有25%的差异。即使这样也没有看上去那么令人兴奋，因为得分最低的学生也更有可能缺席，错过他们的课堂学习时间。我没有努力去适应这个。

One thing you can’t see in that chart is the high variance that existed within the top quintile. In this group, time spent studying varied from 33 hours to 12 — and 12 was the top student! Anecdotally, I perceived two distinct subgroups of high performers: highly motivated learners who had a natural disadvantage, like being a foreign exchange student speaking a second language, and high IQ avid reader types. The former put in far more hours than the latter. In fact, that second group put in less time than the average bottom quintile student.

在那张图表中你看不到的一件事是存在于前五分位中的高方差。在这组学生中，学习时间从33小时到12小时不等，其中12小时是最优秀的学生！有趣的是，我发现了两个不同的高绩效群体：高动机的学习者有天生的劣势，比如说第二语言的外国交换生，和高智商的读者类型。前者投入的时间远远多于后者。事实上，第二组学生投入的时间比平均最低五分之一的学生要少。

Only a very small number of highly motivated students showed signs of studying over weekends and breaks.

只有极少数积极性很高的学生表现出周末和休息时间学习的迹象。

### SRS signal, or just conscientiousness?

### 是信号，还是认真？

While you can see a much stronger signal in the “Set Level” and “% of Cards Started” columns, it’s hard to know how much this is just measuring conscientiousness. Good students are going to do what they’re asked to do, and get the good grade no matter what, but this doesn’t mean that what they’re asked to do is always necessary to get the good grade — or that the grade reflects anything worthwhile in the first place.

虽然你可以在“设置等级”和“%的卡片开始”栏中看到一个更强烈的信号，但很难知道这仅仅是在衡量认真程度。好学生会做他们被要求做的事情，不管做什么都会得到好成绩，但这并不意味着他们被要求做的事情总是获得好成绩所必需的——或者说成绩首先反映了任何有价值的东西。

### People persons

### 人

At least a few of the students I could never get to study Cerego were very on-the-ball whenever we did any kind of verbal review. 

至少有几个我永远也学不到的学生，每当我们做口头复习的时候，他们都很活跃。

[I’ve seen a lot of this pattern during the pandemic. Students who seemed like inert lumps online, with very low grades, have in many cases returned to the classroom and revealed themselves to be dynamic and invested. An engaging human at the front of the room really is the “value add” of in-person instruction. This is something I encourage my peers to keep in mind whenever deciding between autonomous work and teacher-student interaction.]

[我在大流行期间见过很多这种模式。那些在网上看起来像个呆板的学生，成绩很低，在很多情况下，他们回到了课堂，表现出活力和投入。在教室前面的一个引人入胜的人真的是当面指导的“增值”。这是我鼓励我的同龄人在决定自主工作和师生互动时要牢记的一点。]

### High automaticity in high achievers

### 高成就者的高度自动化

When it came to automaticity, outlier results were more impressive than ever. The very small number of students at the overlap of highly motivated, highly intelligent, and highly competitive absolutely crushed it in the review game we regularly played at my interactive whiteboard, beating *me* on several occasions, which almost never happened previously.

在自动化方面，异常结果比以往任何时候都更令人印象深刻。在我们经常在互动白板上玩的复习游戏中，只有极少数的学生在高度积极性、高度智慧和高度竞争的交集中完全击败了我，在以前几乎从未发生过这种情况。

### Weak transference?

### 移情能力弱？

However, transference to other contexts was less evident. In my first report, I had remarked on [anecdotal impressions](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Those_discussions___) of higher-quality discussion and essay responses from those who had embraced our Anki review, suggesting that they had truly enlarged their lexicon to be able to talk about more complex ideas. I saw less of that this year. I don’t know what that means. It could just be that this mix of students was less open with their thoughts. But I can also see how they may have seen the Cerego universe as [distinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria) from the universe of essay and discussion. Whole-class Anki might be more resistant to this bifurcation by making us say the words out loud to each other, normalizing their use.

然而，移情到其他环境是不太明显的。在我的第一次报告中，我谈到了[轶事印象](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ww2dxwWpSfkQB4NZb/a-year-of-spaced-repetition-software-in-the-classroom#Those_discussions___)更高质量的讨论和论文回应来自那些接受我们的Anki评论的人，表明他们确实扩大了词汇量，能够谈论更复杂的想法。今年我看到的少了。我不知道那是什么意思。这可能只是因为这些学生对自己的思想不够开放。但我也能看出他们是如何看待塞雷戈宇宙的(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria)来自散文和讨论的世界。全班同学安基可能会更抗拒这种分歧，让我们大声地说出来的话，他们的使用正常化。

### Drama benchmark analysis

### 戏剧基准分析

To compare methodologies as directly as possible, for a third year running I handled my Drama unit the way I accidentally had during my first year of classroom SRS: some terms taught before the pre-test, most taught after the pre-test, an identical post-test much later, and no review of any of it except through the SRS.

为了尽可能直接地比较教学方法，在第三年的教学中，我像在第一年的SRS课堂教学中那样处理我的戏剧单元：一些术语是在考前教的，大部分是在考前教的，一个相同的后测要晚得多，除了通过SRS之外，没有任何复习。

The overall results in the Drama unit were slightly worse this year. This was surprising. This cohort started lower on the pre-test, which was consistent with my impression of them, but I predicted that we would at least match or exceed last year’s gains, as we had more room to improve. We did not. Retention of some reliable bellwether terms actually dropped prior to the post-test. In picking through individual scores, my impression was that whole-class Anki and independent in-class Cerego were statistically equivalent for motivated learners, but whole-class Anki won easily with less motivated learners. As always, there were plenty of truly unmotivated students who got nothing from either method.

今年戏剧组的整体成绩稍差。这令人惊讶。这一组人在预测试中的分数开始较低，这与我对他们的印象是一致的，但我预测我们至少会赶上或超过去年的成绩，因为我们还有更多的提升空间。我们没有。一些可靠的领头羊术语的保留率实际上在后测试之前就下降了。在挑选个人分数时，我的印象是，全班的Anki和班内独立的Cerego在统计学上对积极的学习者是等价的，但是全班Anki在积极性较低的学习者中很容易获胜。像往常一样，有很多真正没有动力的学生从这两种方法中一无所获。

I tried to tease this out even further. This was pretty unscientific, but I took the pre and post-test scores of twenty students from last year, and aligned them individually to students from this year with similar pre-test scores and, in my view, similar work ethics. Highly motivated students starting very low may have done slightly better with Cerego than with Anki, but poorly motivated students starting low did somewhat better with Anki. 

我试着更进一步地梳理这个问题。这是相当不科学的，但我从去年的20名学生的考前和考后分数中，将他们分别与今年的学生进行对比，他们的考前分数和我认为的工作道德都差不多。动机很低的学生用Cerego可能比用Anki做得稍微好一些，但是动机很低的学生用Anki做得稍微好一些。

I’m sure a lot of this came down to how Cerego makes new card sets “opt-in”. Students of lower motivation were less likely to encounter the Drama terms in their study rotation at all!

我敢肯定，这很大程度上取决于Cerego如何“选择加入”新卡组。动机较低的学生在他们的学习轮换中不太可能遇到戏剧术语！

Phone vs. Computer seemed to make a difference here, too. Stuck with a very visible PC, some low performers would occasionally have good days and get in a groove. The ones glued to their phones found anything to do except Cerego.

电话和电脑在这里似乎也有不同。在一台非常显眼的PC上，一些表现不佳的人偶尔会有好日子，进入一种状态。那些粘在手机上的人发现除了塞雷戈什么都做不了。

## Conclusions (2017)

## 结论（2017）

If I see students as being ultimately responsible for their own learning, independent Cerego is the fairer approach that will help students get what they “deserve”. If I see things more pragmatically and utilitarian (as I do), the numbers favor the whole-class Anki approach. And yet...

如果我认为学生对自己的学习负有最终责任，那么独立的Cerego是一种更公平的方法，它将帮助学生得到他们“应得的”。如果我把事情看得更务实、更功利（就像我一样），那么数字更倾向于全班的Anki方法。但是。。。

If I were staying at that school, with my classroom computers, I would have tried to get the best of both worlds. It was my plan to use Cerego again — having already done most of the legwork — and try to make it friendlier, with more teacher interaction, supplementing with some whole-class Anki. I would have pushed Cerego’s developers to make some of my most wanted changes, and I would have pushed myself to cut back on the number of cards I used.

如果我留在那所学校，用我的教室电脑，我会努力做到两全其美。我的计划是再次使用Cerego——已经做了大部分的腿部工作——并尝试让它更友好，更多的老师互动，补充一些全班的Anki。我会督促Cerego的开发人员做一些我最想做的更改，我也会督促自己减少使用的卡的数量。

But it’s moot, now. I won’t have computers at my new school. And part of the reason I left was because I didn’t like the feel of the groove I was settling into.

但现在没有意义了。我的新学校没有电脑了。我离开的部分原因是因为我不喜欢我所处的状态。

Whole-class Anki review wins for simplicity and camaraderie. Cerego wins for surveillance and power. Which would you want to see stamping on a teenage face forever?

全班安基评论赢得简单和友情。塞雷戈赢得了监视和权力。你想看到哪个永远印在年轻人的脸上？

Trick question! It’s not nice to stamp on faces. I feel like I’ve been pushing SRS too far past the point of diminishing returns, and I don’t know why it has become an annual tradition for me to vow to cut back next year and then fail to do so. I should probably break that cycle. Apathy is the enemy, and she remains unbowed. I’ve been looking for a technological fix, but I think the solution is, at best, only partly technological.

骗人的问题！在脸上跺脚不好。我觉得我已经把SRS推得太远了，已经过了回报递减的阶段，我不知道为什么我发誓明年要削减，但却没有做到这一点，已经成为每年的传统。我应该打破这种循环。冷漠是敌人，她仍然不受约束。我一直在寻找一个技术上的解决方案，但我认为解决方案充其量只是部分技术上的。

[My notes here spiraled off into very technological solutions (sigh) to add to my dream SRS+ app, which I had already postponed again but still wasn’t ready to abandon. I suppose I can give myself a little credit for brainstorming features to encourage human interaction and conceptual connections. Eventually, my notes came back to some thoughts about what makes a class thrive, which I have translated into coherent sentences below.]

[我在这里的笔记变成了非常技术化的解决方案（叹气），添加到我的梦想SRS+应用程序中，我已经再次推迟了，但仍然没有准备放弃。我想我可以给自己一个小小的荣誉来鼓励人类互动和概念联系的头脑风暴功能。最后，我的笔记又回到了一些关于是什么让一门课兴旺发达的想法，我把这些想法翻译成了下面连贯的句子。]

From a scalability standpoint, it’s nice that something like Cerego doesn’t depend on a teacher’s charm the way my whole-class Anki approach does. Teachers could do a lot worse than a standardized pack of quality Cerego sets that reinforce matching cookie-cutter lessons. But couldn’t teachers also do better? I think *I* could do better. Cerego and Canvas quizzes create distance between me and my students. But I want to bring us closer and dial up the enthusiasm.

从可伸缩性的角度来看，像Cerego这样的东西不像我的全班Anki方法那样依赖于老师的魅力，这很好。教师可以做得比标准化的一包高质量的谷类食品更糟糕，因为它们可以强化配套的饼干切割器课程。但老师们难道不能做得更好吗？我想我可以做得更好。Cerego和Canvas测验在我和学生之间建立了距离。但我想拉近我们的距离，提高热情。

I don’t think gamification is the answer. I’ve been noticing that the appeal of games is pretty niche, failing to capture many from the apathetic middle, and then for the wrong reasons, with the wrong incentives.

我不认为游戏化是答案。我已经注意到，游戏的吸引力是相当小的，未能从冷漠的中间抓住许多人，然后出于错误的原因，以错误的动机。

So what would work?

那么什么能起作用呢？

In education research, it always looks like *everything* works at least a little bit. This is probably a combination of publication bias and the fact that teachers sometimes get excited to try something new. Excitement is infectious. This gets students more engaged, which then improves outcomes. My early success with classroom SRS — and subsequent disappointments — would certainly fit that pattern.

在教育研究中，似乎每件事都至少起一点作用。这可能是出版偏见和教师有时对尝试新事物感到兴奋的事实的结合。兴奋是有感染力的。这会让学生更加投入，进而提高成绩。我在课堂SRS方面的早期成功——以及随后的失望——肯定符合这种模式。

Maybe I should make a point of trying new things each year for the explicit purpose of exploiting the excitement factor? How would I explain that to my bosses? “Well, I deliberately diverged from the curriculum and accepted best practice because I grew weary of them.”

也许我应该每年都尝试新的东西，明确的目的是利用刺激因素？我该怎么向我的老板解释呢？”嗯，我故意偏离课程，接受最佳实践，因为我对它们感到厌倦了。”

[Yes, actually. My new bosses are great that way.]

[是的，事实上。我的新老板就是这样的

# Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis (2021)

# 论文，对立，综合（2021）

As a student of storytelling, I can’t help but find an arc to my fourteen years of teaching up to this point.

作为一个讲故事的学生，我忍不住找到了自己十四年教学生涯的一个转折点。

When I first started out, I didn’t know what I was doing but kept Apathy at bay through sheer passion. I worked harder than anyone. I couldn’t wait to try my stuff out, and students responded to all but my cringiest overtures.

当我刚开始工作的时候，我不知道自己在做什么，但通过纯粹的激情，我克制住了冷漠。我比任何人都努力。我迫不及待地想尝试一下我的东西，学生们对我最卑鄙的提议都做出了回应。

When this inevitably exhausted me, I had a hard slump. Lessons that used to work fell flat. I still didn’t know what I was doing, and now lacked sufficient passion to brute force success. So I retreated into systems and structure, building word banks, prompt banks, quiz banks; rubrics, charts, and randomizers; running reports; slinging code. A suit of high-tech power armor to augment my feeble form. A different kind of brute force.

当这不可避免地使我筋疲力尽的时候，我有一个严重的沮丧。以前有用的课程没用了。我仍然不知道自己在做什么，现在缺乏足够的激情来强行取得成功。所以我退回到系统和结构，建立单词库，提示库，测验库；评估准则、图表和随机化者；运行报告；吊码。一套高科技的强力盔甲来增强我虚弱的身体。一种不同的暴力。

My systems gave me stability and staying power, and, eventually, the confidence to explore. My three years of heavy SRS experimentation were the culmination of this phase. I stretched. I grew. But I still felt plateaued and frustrated, perhaps having taken systems as far as they could go.

我的系统给了我稳定性和持久力，最终，给了我探索的信心。我三年的重型SRS实验是这一阶段的高潮。我伸了个懒腰。我长大了。但我仍然感到停滞不前和沮丧，也许已经采取了系统，因为他们可以去。

Apathy still mocked me from her emoji throne.

冷漠仍然在她的表情宝座上嘲笑我。

I step out of the armor and find I no longer need it. One by one, my systems clatter to the ground. I know who I am. I know where my power comes from. And I know my enemy.

我走出盔甲，发现我不再需要它了。我的系统一个接一个地轰鸣着。我知道我是谁。我知道我的力量来自哪里。我认识我的敌人。

She will lose, because she is overconfident. She won’t prepare, because she is indifferent. And she won’t hear my warning, because I issue it now in the one place I know she’ll never reach: the bottom of a 10,000 word essay.

她会输的，因为她过于自信。她不准备，因为她漠不关心。她不会听到我的警告，因为我现在把它放在一个我知道她永远不会到达的地方：一篇一万字的文章的底部。

*I’m coming for you.*
*我来找你*
