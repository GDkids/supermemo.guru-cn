## Introduction

## 引言

This is a short story of a sad preschooler subjected to early academic instructions. It demonstrates the dangers of [coercive teaching](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coercion_in_learning).

这是一个关于一个悲伤的学龄前儿童受到早期学业指导的短篇故事。它证明了强制教学的危险性。

## Kid that can't get his numbers straight 

## 那个连数字都记不清的孩子

Tobias is 6 years old and he told me he was crying. He is just about to go to school. His pro-active mom considered his counting skills well behind the curve *"These days, 4 year olds can count up to 100"*. Tobias can only count up to 13. From then on, it goes on like this 15, 17, 14, 18, 19, 15, and so on. The sequence is different at each try. Tobias is very smart. He can tell me things about car engines I have never heard of. I would not worry about his counting. This is not dyscalculia. This is just his brain not being ready. I can confirm this easily. When I try to teach him to count 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, he is fluent and automatic. However, when I disrupt his sequence by adding *"teen"* after each digit, he gets confused easily. It is again *3-teen, 4-teen, 7-teen, 9-teen*, and back to *5-teen*. He clearly developed an automatic sequence memory and that sequence gets easily killed by any form of disruption. This is a type of early fluency that is not as universal as that of an adult who may think *3-teen, 4-teen* trick is easy to do.

托拜厄斯今年 6 岁，他告诉我他哭了。他正要去上学。他积极主动的母亲认为他的数数技能远远落后于曲线，“现在，4 岁的孩子可以数到 100”。托拜厄斯只能数到 13。从 13 之后，就像这样：15,17,14,18,19,15，等等。每次尝试的顺序是不同的。托拜厄斯很聪明。他能告诉我一些我从未听说过的汽车引擎的事情。我不担心他的数数。这不是计算障碍。这只是他的大脑还没有准备好。我可以很容易地证实这一点。当我试着教他数 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 的时候，他能流利而自然地数出来。然而，当我在每个数字后面加上 “teen”，打乱了他的顺序时，他很容易就搞混了。又是 3-teen，4-teen，7-teen，9-teen，回到 5-teen。他显然发展出了一种自动序列记忆，这种序列很容易被任何形式的干扰破坏掉。这是一种早期流利能力，并不像成年人那样普遍，后者可能认为 3-teen，4-teen 的把戏很容易做到。

## Empathy for a crying kid

## 同情哭泣的孩子

I asked Tobias why he was crying. He said, his mom took away his computer because he could not count. She claimed he refused to cooperate. It is easy to think the kid is uncooperative if the job is just beyond his brain's capacity. It is awfully hard for an adult to think that the sequence 13, 14, 15, etc. is difficult, and failure must be kid's fault. For a bit of empathy, I suggest the parent try to learn the same sequence in Chinese. Even then, it is easy to fall back on English names and the student only needs to link English numbers with Chinese numbers. She does not need to produce a fluent Chinese sequence. Most adults are pretty confident they can learn to count up to 20 in Chinese in 20 minutes. Indeed, some can do it. Once they do, they boast with a big smile. Again, [good learning is pleasurable](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning). For those who find Chinese easy, another test is to remember a simple poem and then recite it by inserting *drake-* before each syllable. For example, try this text, if you know it well:

我问托拜厄斯他为什么哭。他说，他妈妈拿走了他的电脑，因为他不会数数。她声称他拒绝合作。如果这份工作超出了孩子大脑的能力范围，很容易认为孩子不合作。对于一个成年人来说，很难想象 13、14、15 等序列是困难的，而且失败肯定是孩子的错。为了表示一点同情，我建议家长试着用中文学习同样的顺序。即使这样，学生也很容易依赖英文名称，只需要把英文数字和中文数字联系起来。她不需要产生一个流利的中文序列。大多数成年人都相当自信，他们可以在 20 分钟内学会用中文数到 20。的确，有些人可以做到。一旦他们这样做了，他们就会笑得很开心。同样，良好的学习是令人愉快的。对于那些觉得汉语很简单的人来说，另一个测试是记住一首简单的诗，然后在每个音节后插入 drake 来背诵。例如，如果你熟悉下面的文字，可以试试:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness
>
> 我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的，人人生而平等，造物主赋予他们若干不可剥夺的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利

Convert it fast to *we-drake, hold-drake, these-drake, truths-drake, to-drake, be-drake, self-drake, evi-drake, dent-drake ...*, etc. Easy? If you struggle, you feel the child's pain with 4-teen, 5-teen, 6-teen. Parents keep forgetting that a [child's brain is different](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_amnesia), and is [not ready for such rote feats](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_does_not_work_for_kids). Kids get their learning rewards differently.

快速转换成：我们-drake，认为-drake，这些-drake，真理-drake，是-drake，不言-drake，而喻-drake，的-drake... 等等。简单？如果你觉得很困难，你会感受到孩子的痛苦，比如 4-teen，5-teen，6-teen。父母总是忘记孩子的大脑是不同的，也没有为这样的死记硬背做好准备。孩子们得到不同的学习回报。

## Happiness of math discovery

## 数学探索的快乐

I had a short chat with Tobias about numbers. I wanted to confirm what I suspected is likely to be true. He admitted that he needs his computer for playing computer games. He also admitted that some games include virtual monetary rewards. It is impossible to play some of those games effectively without having a good number sense. I would write numbers in sand and ask Tobias to name them. Exactly as expected, he struggled with 17, 28, 53, etc. He reads 23 as two-thirteen. However, I also predicted correctly he would know 100 and 1000. Even better, he knew them all 200, 300, ... 900, and 2000, 3000, ... 9000. He also knows that millions and billions are very big and very good. A lesser adult will ask *"What for billions? For school, he only needs to count up to 20"*. Schools condition compliance, which makes adults forget that [coherent knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence) is valuable independent of when and how it had been acquired. In addition, a good number sense at early age, provides a mnemonic structure for building more knowledge. Last but not least, all computer literate kids know that one gigabyte stands for one billion bytes. For kids, this knowledge is gold.

我和托拜厄斯就数字问题进行了简短的交谈。我想证实我所怀疑的可能是真的。他承认他需要电脑来玩电脑游戏。他还承认，一些游戏包含虚拟货币奖励。如果没有很好的数字判断力，有些游戏是不可能有效地玩的。我会把数字写在沙子上，然后让托拜厄斯说出来。正如预期的那样，他在 17,28,53 等等的位置上挣扎着。他把 23 读作 two-thirteen。不过，我也准确地预测到，他会知道 100 和 1000。更妙的是，他知道他们所有的 200,300，... 900，和 2000,3000，... 9000。他也知道数百万和数十亿是非常大和非常好的。一个不那么成熟的成年人会问“几十亿是为了干什么？到了学校，他只需要数到 20”。学校规定了服从的条件，这使得成年人忘记了连贯的知识是有价值的，不管它是什么时候以及如何获得的。此外，在幼年时期具有良好的数字感知能力，为学习更多知识提供了一种助记结构。最后但并非最不重要的是，所有懂电脑的孩子都知道 1gb 代表 10 亿字节。对于孩子们来说，这些知识就是金子。

Tobias knows that the more digits there are to the number, the better the reward. He also knows that numbers that begin with 9 are better than numbers that begin with 1 as long as they are of the same length in digits. Using computer games that his mom has just banned, Tobias developed a good sense of numbers. He cannot put them well in a sequence, but he can look at a number and guess how "good" it is. This is how little brains work. They do not employ rote memorization to cram a sequence (in [20 rules](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules) we call it a *list*). They employ neural network generalization to figure out the rules. The rules that govern the world of numbers. This can be counterintuitive to a parent, but those rules are far more useful in understanding the world of numbers than a dry sequence 13..19.

托拜厄斯知道数字的位数越多，奖励越好。他也知道以 9 开头的数字比以 1 开头的数字要好，只要它们在数字上的长度相同。通过使用他妈妈刚刚禁止的电脑游戏，托拜厄斯发展出了一种很好的数字感知。他不能很好地把他们放在一个序列，但他可以看一个数字并猜测有多“好”。这就是小脑袋的工作原理。他们不采用死记硬背的方法去填充一个序列(在 20 条规则中我们称之为列表)。他们使用神经网络泛化来计算规则。统治数字世界的规则。这对父母来说可能是违反直觉的，但是这些规则在理解数字世界时比枯燥的序列 13...19 要好。

I got my final reassurance when I asked Tobias *"How much is 2\*2?"*. He perked up and said *"Four!"* with a big smile. *"And 2\*3?"*. *"Six!"*. Multiplication is no big deal for a six year old except ... nobody has ever taught multiplication table to Tobias. This "teaching omission" resulted from the assumption that there is no need to move to "advanced" concepts such as the multiplication table if the kid struggles with counting.

当我问托拜厄斯 “2 * 2是多少？”他振作起来说：“4！”带着灿烂的笑容。“那 2 * 3 呢？”。“6 ！”。乘法对一个六岁的孩子来说没什么大不了的，除......没有人教过托拜厄斯乘法表。这种“教学疏漏”源于这样一种假设，即如果孩子在数数上遇到困难，就没有必要转向诸如乘法表这样的“先进”概念。

## Hating school in advance

## 提前讨厌学校

My last question was about schools. Most kids are pretty happy to go to school. However, when I asked Tobias, he resolutely said he already hates school. Kids have poor memory. In a week, he may change his mind and the damage will be negligible as long as he is not getting hammered for confusing 15 with 18 over and over again. He might fear those numbers and develop [acquired dyscalculia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Toxic_memory) or math anxiety or general hate of academic instruction. Luckily, Tobias is not a cry baby that would [easily get damaged](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience). On a football field he is tough. It was the [stress of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coercion_in_learning) or mom's harshness that cracked his shell.

我最后一个问题是关于学校的。大多数孩子都很乐意去上学。然而，当我问托拜厄斯时，他坚决地说他已经厌恶学校了。孩子的记忆力很差。一周之内，他可能会改变主意，只要他不因为一次又一次地把 15 和 18 搞混而受到打击，伤害就可以忽略不计。他可能害怕这些数字，发展成后天计算障碍或数学焦虑或对学术指导的普遍厌恶。幸运的是，托拜厄斯不是一个容易受伤的爱哭鬼。在足球场上，他很强硬。是学习的压力或者妈妈的严厉打破了他的外壳。

## Advice to parents

## 给家长的建议

I know I cannot tell parents what to do. Like kids at school, parents hate to be given instructions, esp. by strangers. I only mentioned to Tobias's mom that I am writing a [book about schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_schooling) and that the overarching principle is that [without pleasure there is no good learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning). She agreed! I can only hope that next time, she will notice that putting her kid to [tears over numbers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coercion_in_learning) is a blatant violation of that principle. Letting him play those money games on the computer, on the other hand, would be learning with pleasure. A bit of supervision would be necessary to see if the kid does not slide down a gambling path. However, [Gabor Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_Maté_(physician)) says that for a happy kid there is little need to compensate with addictions. Gaming may take longer to get the kid to the goal of number sense, but those math generalizations can last for life. Good [coherent](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence) and mnemonic numerical framework is a capital that delivers interest throughout lifetime. With that capital calculations are easier, learning math is easier, logical reasoning improves, and the ultimate [hallmark of intelligence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist), [problem solving capacity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F) is the most precious beneficiary.

我知道我不能告诉父母该做什么。就像学校里的孩子一样，父母讨厌被指教，尤其是被陌生人指教。我只是向托拜厄斯的妈妈提到，我正在写一本关于学校教育的书，而最重要的原则就是没有快乐就没有好的学习。她同意了！我只希望下一次，她会注意到让她的孩子为数字而流泪是对这一原则的公然违反。另一方面，让他在电脑上玩那些金钱游戏，将是愉快的学习。一点监督是必要的，看看这个孩子是否滑下赌博的道路。然而，Gabor Mate 说，对于一个快乐的孩子来说，几乎没有必要去弥补成瘾的问题。游戏可能需要更长的时间才能让孩子达到数字感知的目标，但是这些数学泛化可以持续一生。良好的连贯性和记忆性的数值框架是一种终生都能带来利息的资本。有了这些资本计算变得更容易，学习数学变得更容易，逻辑推理提高，而智力的终极标志——解决问题的能力是最宝贵的受益者。
