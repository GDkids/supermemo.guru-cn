# Tree growth metaphor 树木生长比喻

Given enough time and access to knowledge-rich environments, without the need for an education system, the knowledge of an individual grows into a large, comprehensive, and [coherent body](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence). This is true of all free, and healthy individuals. The size and the quality of the tree may depend on one's personality, interests, and the starting point of the intellectual development. However, one of the chief myths of education is that the organic growth of knowledge leads to multiple biases and [areas of ignorance](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling). Those blank spots are allegedly larger than those that remain after years of schooling. Due to the computational power of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive), and the phenomenon of [emergence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence), the opposite is true. The metaphor I like to use to explain the power of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) is that of a tree growth.

如果有足够的时间和机会进入知识丰富的环境，不需要教育系统，个人的知识就会成长为一个庞大、全面且连贯的整体。所有自由、健康的个体都是如此。这棵树的大小和质量可能取决于一个人的个性、兴趣和智力发展的起点。然而，教育的一个主要误区是，知识的有机增长产生了多重偏见和无知领域。据称，这些空白区比接受多年教育后留下的空白区要大。由于学习动力的计算能力，以及涌现现象，情况正好相反。我喜欢用一个比喻来解释学习动力的力量，那就是一棵树的生长。

Natural growth of individual human knowledge can be compared to a growth of a tree. Individuals cells in the [meristem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meristem) of a tree twig know very little of the tree and its global growth goals. The meristem follows simple hormonal, biochemical, or biophysical rules (e.g. apical dominance). Those simple rules guiding growth towards light are highly efficient and the tree can shape its crowns beautifully. It will also efficiently organize into a canopy with other species. Force of gravity is tackled optimally. Redistribution of nutrients is easy. Absorption of light is excellent. All obstacles, e.g. other trees, rocks or lamp posts, are handled with ease. Similar mechanisms ensure an efficient growth of a plant root system. A simple set of local rules is also employed by the growth cone in sprouting new neural connections in the brain.

人类个人知识的自然生长可以比作一棵树的生长。树枝分生组织中的个体细胞对这棵树及其全局生长目标知之甚少。分生组织遵循简单的激素、生化或生物物理规则(如顶端优势)。那些引导向光生长的简单规则是高效的，树可以漂亮地塑造它的树冠。它还将与其他物种有效地组织成一个树冠。重力是解决问题的最佳方法。营养物质的重新分配很容易。对光的吸收极佳。所有障碍物，例如其他树木、岩石或灯柱，都很容易处理。类似的机制确保了植物根系的有效生长。生长锥在大脑中萌发新的神经连接时也采用了一套简单的局部规则。

The tree of knowledge works along similar principles. The [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) mechanism makes sure that individual leaves of memory crave light of new discovery and sprout branches in the direction of inspiration. Locally, the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) may seem simple and blind. Globally we grow great individuals with erudite knowledge needed to support all vital human functions in society. Self-learning brains can fit any environment and fulfill all imaginable human goals.

知识之树遵循相似的原则工作。学习动力机制确保了个体记忆的叶子渴望新发现的曙光，并朝着灵感的方向发芽。在局部，学习动力可能看起来简单而盲目。在全局范围内，我们成长为拥有支持社会中所有重要人类功能所需的博学知识的伟大个体。自学的大脑可以适应任何环境，可以实现所有可以想象到的人类目标。

As much as trees need water, CO2, some nutrients and light, brains need energy, rich input, and unconstrained freedom. All attempts at coercive regulation suppress the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) and the tree of knowledge fails to germinate on its own

正如树木需要水、二氧化碳、一些营养物质和光线一样，大脑也需要能量、丰富的投入和不受约束的自由。所有强制管制的尝试都会抑制学习动力，知识之树就不会自己发芽。
