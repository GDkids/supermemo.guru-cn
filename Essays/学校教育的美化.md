# Glorification of schooling 学校教育的美化

## Stockholm syndrome

## 斯德哥尔摩综合症

Most of the adult population tends to praise the value of schools. The basis of that praise is a cognitive bias I call *"glorification of schooling"*. The bias is the reason for which the [Prussian model of schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Prussian_model_of_schooling) still survives in a democracy despite having many hallmarks of **[childhood slavery](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/End_school_slavery)**.

大多数成年人往往会赞扬学校的价值。这种赞扬的基础是一种认知偏见，我称之为 "学校教育的美化"。这种偏见是普鲁士的学校教育模式尽管有许多**儿童奴隶制**的特征，但仍然在民主国家中存在的原因。

When adults say bad things about school, they will invariably blame the implementation. Rarely do they see system design problems that cannot be resolved.

当大人们说学校的坏话时，他们总会把责任归咎于执行。他们很少看到无法解决的制度设计问题。

Most of the teen population expresses dislikes or hate of schools (see: [Why kids hate school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_kids_hate_school)). They experience reality on the daily basis and this judgement is most reliable. This judgement should be respected. On a rare occasion, a young student may praise her school. Despite having a thousand face-to-face conversations, in the last five years, I know only two cases of kids genuinely praising school (as of Feb 2020). Both students recanted their testimony (see: [Why kids like school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_kids_like_school)).

大多数青少年群体都表示不喜欢或讨厌学校（见：孩子们为什么讨厌学校）。他们每天都在体验现实，这种判断是最可靠的。这种判断应该得到尊重。在极少数情况下，青少年学生可能会称赞她的学校。尽管有上千次面对面的交谈，但在过去五年里，我只知道两例孩子们真正赞美学校的情况（截至2020年2月）。两位学生都收回了他们的证词（见：孩子为什么喜欢学校）。

When the adults praise school, I always see one or more reasons to believe this to be the case of **glorification of schooling**. Here are the key reasons:

当大人们赞美学校时，我总能看到一个或多个理由，相信这是**美化学校教育**的案例。以下是主要原因：

- [generalizing](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization) power of the brain (we tend to model things as black or white as explained later)
- 大脑的泛化能力（我们倾向于将事物建模得非黑即白，后面会解释）
- generalizing the freedom of college while whitewashing the slavery of [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling)
- 将大学的自由泛化，而将义务教育的奴性粉饰
- reattribution of merit from one's own brain to schools
- 把某人大脑的功劳归功于学校
- empathy problem (an adult is unable to empathize with a first grader due to the nature of the [conceptualization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptualization) process, esp. [childhood amnesia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_amnesia))
- 同理心问题（由于概念化过程的性质，成人无法对一年级学生产生同理心，特别是童年失忆症）
- unfulfilled dreams (failure at school that seems remediable in adulthood)
- 未实现的梦想(在学校的失败，成年后似乎可以补救)
- having kids at school that calls for a good justification for one's own actions
- 在学校里有孩子，需要为自己的行为找好理由

When an adult says she would love to experience again her days of school, it is most likely associated with the romantic notion of schooling where students engage in inspirational conversations with enlightened wise men. That wish is definitely whitewashed from the possibility of making the whole enterprise compulsory, or based on grading one's performance and intellect, or involving most hated subjects, or waking up early, or meeting bullies, God-like unpleasant figures, or frustrated adults. The romantic notion of schooling involves no stress and no injury to one's self-esteem. It is an extension of the [pleasure of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning) to a social context of a broad-minded institution. Compare: [Introduce Mandatory Adult Education!](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Introduce_Mandatory_Adult_Education!)

当一个成年人说她很想再次经历她的学校时代时，很可能与学校教育的浪漫概念联系在一起，在那里，学生与开明的智者进行励志的对话。这种愿望绝对会被粉饰，因为有可能把整个事业变成强制性的，或基于对一个人的表现和智力的分级，或涉及最讨厌的科目，或早起，或遇到欺负，神一样的不愉快的人物，或沮丧的成年人。浪漫的求学观念涉及的是没有压力，不伤自尊。它是将学习的乐趣延伸到一个心胸宽广的社会环境中。比较：推行成人义务教育！

## Brain: Generalizer-in-Chief

## 大脑：主泛化器

The key reason for praising school in adulthood is that the brain naturally [generalizes](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization) all memories. This is why adults recall episodes or periods as *great* or *awful* to a statistically implausible degree. Those who glorify school years are subject to the rosy retrospection bias. The **glorification of schooling** poses a serious threat to the success of the [Grand Education Reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Education_Reform). The problem is magnified by the fact that smart people tend to be biased towards *great experience* in reference to [schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling). Those who recall school years as *awful* tend to keep their mouth shut. They do not feel they are entitled to speak up. They blame themselves, not the school, for their failure. One of the main factors in the **glorification of schooling** is the **[survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)**: we tend to look at the surviving winners, and forget the large gray mass of those left behind.

成年后称赞学校的关键原因是，大脑会自然而然地将所有记忆泛化。这就是为什么成年人回忆起的情节或时期是伟大的或可怕的，在统计学上是不可信的。那些美化上学时期的人，都会有玫瑰色的回忆偏差。**学校教育的美化**，对大教育改革的成功构成了严重的威胁。聪明人在提到学校教育时，往往会偏向于伟大的经历，这就使问题更加严重。那些回忆起学校时期糟糕经历的人，往往会闭口不谈。他们不觉得自己有资格说出来。他们把失败的原因归咎于自己，而不是学校。**学校教育的美化**的主要因素之一是幸存者的偏见：我们倾向于看那些幸存的胜利者，而忘记了那些被遗弃的大量灰色群众。

Mea culpa. I did not speak up either. I thought my school years were pretty successful. This kept me blind to the [Problem of Schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling).

恕我直言。我也没有说出来。我以为我的上学时代是很成功的。这让我对学校教育的问题视而不见。

## A case study

## 案例研究

I have documented a nice case of glorification that literally unfolded before my eyes. This is about one of my smartest and most influential brains around: Tom, the [handsome man in the picture](http://www.antimoon.com/learners/tomasz_szynalski-large.jpg), is the case study in this text.

我记录了一个很好的美化案例，它真实地展现在我眼前。这是关于我身边最聪明、最有影响力的一个大脑。汤姆，图片中的帅哥，就是本文中的研究案例。

My friend Tom likes the social aspect of schooling. He attributes a great deal of his own success to competitive spirit of his high school. He does not like my [reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform) (yet) for he does not trust the power of [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) (see: [Optimality of the learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimality_of_the_learn_drive)). He is very skeptical about the [hole in the wall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Hole_in_the_wall). He believes in the guiding hand of the adult world.

我的朋友汤姆喜欢学校教育的社会性。他把自己的成功很大程度上归功于高中的竞争精神。他不喜欢我的改革（现在还没有），因为他不相信自由学习的力量（见：学习内驱力的优化）。他对墙洞非常怀疑。他相信成人世界的引导之手。

It would be easy to believe that Tom has good reasons to praise school. Why should we not trust his own experience and his own memory? The reason I use Tom as my case study is that he compiled all necessary evidence in his own blog. The details of his educational story clearly demonstrate the case of glorification.

我们很容易相信，汤姆有充分的理由赞扬学校。为什么我们不应该相信他自己的经验和他自己的记忆呢？我之所以用汤姆作为我的案例研究，是因为他在自己的博客中整理了所有必要的证据。他的教育故事的细节清楚地展示了美化的案例。

## Mechanism of glorification

## 美化的机制

Smart people show little empathy for a kid's brain. Their thinking is [adultcentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adultcentrism). They see everyone in the lens of their own intellectual experience. This is natural. I need a backup from neuroscience, e.g. in reference to [childhood amnesia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_amnesia) to explain the error of the adultcentric approach.

聪明人对孩子的大脑几乎没有什么同情心。他们的思维是以成人为中心的。他们以自己的知识经验来看待每个人。这是很自然的。我需要神经科学的支持，例如在提到童年失忆症时，来解释以成人为中心的方法的错误。

Tom is a good example of the problem. His IQ is stratospheric. I pestered Tom with mail for one year in reference to [this book](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_schooling). I wanted to provide a case study of how smart brains develop. As a bonus, I got a case study how opposition to free learning is built through rigorous schooling.

汤姆就是一个很好的例子。他的智商是出类拔萃的。为了给这本书提供参考，我写邮件纠缠了汤姆一年。我想提供一个关于聪明大脑如何发展的案例研究。作为奖励，我得到了一个案例，研究如何通过严格的学校教育来建立对自由学习的反对。

One of the most interesting threads in the exchange with Tom was Tom's distorted glorification of his school experience. I never revealed main themes of the book and the first chapter I submitted for Tom's review was the chapter on [Soviet economy](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy). A cocky intellectual, Tom instantly found issues with the chapter. This explains what type of reactions [my reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Education_Reform) might elicit in people who will otherwise agree with my basic claims on how the brain works.

在与汤姆的交流中，最有趣的一条线索是汤姆对自己学校经历的歪曲美化。我从来没有透露过这本书的主旨，我提交给汤姆审阅的第一个章节是关于苏联经济的章节。作为一个过于自信的知识分子，汤姆立刻发现了这一章的问题。这就解释了我的改革可能会引起人们什么样的反应，否则他们会同意我关于大脑如何运作的基本主张。

Tom, grew up in free capitalist Poland, and was a good student in a great high school. His school was arguably the best in the country (e.g. in terms of knowledge contests). This alone may condition students to feel special and grateful.

汤姆，在自由资本主义的波兰长大，在一所伟大的中学里是个好学生。他的学校可以说是全国最好的学校（如在知识竞赛方面）。仅此一点，就可能使学生有条件感到特殊和感激。

Tom was surrounded by extremely smart peers in a very competitive environment. Unlike it was the case with Timothy or Ronnie (see: [Dangers of Straight A](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Dangers_of_being_a_Straight_A_student)), Tom would thrive in competition. The reason was simple: he was among the winners (top 3 in English). At school, winners thrive, losers get depressed.

汤姆在竞争非常激烈的环境中，周围都是极其聪明的同龄人。与蒂莫西或罗尼的情况不同（见：全 A 的危险），汤姆会在竞争中茁壮成长。原因很简单：他是优胜者之一（英语前三名）。在学校里，优胜者会茁壮成长，失败者则会沮丧。

Tom didn't get much taste of communist Poland as a little kid, and today, his leanings are socialist, mostly on noble grounds. This is why before he had a chance to read my biological arguments against [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) he had a peek at my [Soviet Economy metaphor](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy) and reacted:

汤姆小时候没怎么尝过共产主义波兰的滋味，如今，他的倾向是社会主义，理由大多是高尚的。这也是为什么他还没来得及看我反对义务教育的生物学论点，就偷看了我的苏联经济比喻，并作出反应的原因：

> Yours is not an argument against schooling, it's an argument against rigid schooling. All my knowledge of math, programming and languages comes from **being forced** to learn. Why didn't I learn all this stuff when I was in elementary school, with tons of free time? Students should be able to pick subjects, but they should be forced to make a choice. It's crazy to think that keeping kids at home with their working-class parents will result in a flourishing of creativity and intellect. People need mentors, challenges, inspiration, motivation, correction. The job of a good school is to provide those
>
> 
>
> 你的论点不是反对学校教育的论点，而是反对僵化的学校教育的论点。我所有的数学、编程和语言知识都来自于**被迫**学习。为什么我在小学的时候，有大量的自由时间，不学这些东西？学生应该可以选择科目，但应该强迫他们做出选择。把孩子们关在家里，和他们的工薪阶层的父母在一起，会导致创造力和智力的蓬勃发展，这是很疯狂的想法。人们需要导师，需要挑战，需要灵感，需要激励，需要矫正。一所好学校的工作就是提供这些。

Tom's reaction is an instant signal of how difficult it is going to be to put the old [Prussian education system](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Prussian_education_system) to sleep. Tom's words are very convincing and **very wrong**. See: [Compulsory schooling must end](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end)

汤姆的反应一下子就发出了一个信号，那就是要想让普鲁士的旧教育体系陷入沉睡是多么困难。汤姆的话非常有说服力，也**非常错误**。请看：义务教育必须结束

### No credit for two decades of self-learning

### 没有学分地自学二十年

I know that Tom's claim on what he learned at school is false. For nearly two decades after high school, he worked in his own company where programming and English are his chief tools. Blatantly false generalization may indicate that his reaction to [my text](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy) was emotional (see: [falsity vector](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Falsity_vector)). In an emotional state, we often resort to [fast thinking](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fast_thinking). Fast thinking leaves little time for deliberate search of memory banks. It leaves little room for analysis and inference.

我知道，汤姆在学校里学的东西的说法是假的。高中毕业后的近二十年里，他一直在自己的公司工作，编程和英语是他的主要工具。公然虚假的概括可能表明他对我的文字的反应是情绪化的（见：虚假性载体）。在情绪化的状态下，我们常常会采用快速思维。快速思考几乎没有时间去刻意搜索记忆库。它几乎没有留下分析和推理的空间。

Tom's impromptu reaction to learning freedoms is understandable. In fast thinking, we often rely on entrenched dogma. When I was compiling [my CV](http://www.super-memory.com/english/company/wozniak.htm) after graduation, I was proud of the long list of schools, and specialties I could mention. I was proud to mention a degree with honors. My mindset was clear: *education is good, long education is better*. My knee jerk reaction to a concept of a [democratic school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Democratic_school) might have been similar at that time. Three decades later I am wiser though.

汤姆对学习自由的即兴反应是可以理解的。在快速思维中，我们常常依赖根深蒂固的教条。当我毕业后整理简历时，我为自己能提到的一长串学校、专业而自豪。我为能以优异的成绩提到学位而自豪。我的心态很明确：学历好，长学历更好。当时我对民主学校这个概念的膝跳反应可能也是类似的。不过三十年后，我更明智了。

### 8 years of primary school English: no result

### 小学英语 8 年：没有结果

It wasn't difficult to find evidence of Tom's false convictions. He provided a good [description of his own learning history](http://www.antimoon.com/learners/tomasz_szynalski.htm) on [his own website](http://www.antimoon.com/):

要找到汤姆虚假定罪的证据并不难。他在自己的网站上对自己的学习历程进行了很好的描述：

> For 8 years I learned English the way everybody does — by going to English classes. It was awfully ineffective. I did everything that the teachers told me to do: I took notes, I did the homework assignments, everything. **But I didn’t get any results**
>
> 
>
> 8 年来，我用大家的方式学习英语——上英语课。这是非常无效的。我做了老师让我做的一切。我做笔记，我做作业，一切都做了。**但我没有得到任何结果**

In other words, despite his impromptu generalization *"my good English should be credited to schooling",* his own text says that the first 8 years of effort brought no results. 8 years wasted for nothing! This is exactly what happens to most kids. I describe Kuba's 13 futile years here: [13 years of school in a month](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/13_years_of_school_in_a_month), and my own futile 8 years here: [Schools are useless in teaching English!](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schools_are_useless_in_teaching_English!)

换句话说，尽管他即兴概括地说"我的英语好应该归功于学校教育"，但他自己的文字却说，前 8 年的努力没有带来任何结果。8年时间白白浪费了! 这正是大多数孩子的遭遇。我在这里描述了库巴 13 年的徒劳。13 年的学校生活在一个月内，而我自己的 8 年也是徒劳无功：学校在教英语方面毫无用处！

A crowning argument can be found on Tom's website ([source](http://www.antimoon.com/other/englishclass.htm)):

在汤姆的网站上可以找到一个冠冕堂皇的论点（来源）:

> Millions of people around the world waste their time by going to English classes, even though they do not improve their English
>
> 
>
> 全世界数以百万计的人上英语课浪费了他们的时间，即使他们的英语水平没有提高

### Computer games contribute to learning

### 计算机游戏有助于学习

Tom's second generalization could be summarized as *"when my dad confiscated my computer, I stopped wasting time on games, and focused on learning"*. At the same time, his own text says:

汤姆的第二个概括可以概括为 "当我爸爸没收了我的电脑后，我就不再把时间浪费在游戏上，而是把精力放在学习上"。同时，他自己的文字也说：

> Things got a little better [with my English] because of... computer games. Adventure games like Monkey Island 2 were my only source of input in elementary school. I had to understand at least some English to progress in the game
>
> 
>
> 因为电脑游戏，我的英语水平有了一定的提高。像《猴岛2》这样的冒险游戏是我小学时唯一的输入来源。我至少要懂一些英语才能在游戏中取得进步。

### Learning occurs without a teacher

### 学习是在没有老师的情况下进行的

Computer games helped Tom understand that he may not necessarily need a teacher:

电脑游戏帮助汤姆明白，他不一定需要老师：

> As I looked at the grammar questions, I noticed that I could sometimes tell the right answer just because it sounded good and the other answers sounded bad to me. [...] For the first time, I thought that maybe you don’t need a teacher to explain grammar to you; maybe you can just “absorb it” by reading in English
>
> 
>
> 当我看语法题时，我注意到，我有时能说出正确的答案，只是因为它听起来不错，而其他答案对我来说听起来很糟糕。[......]我第一次觉得，也许你不需要老师给你解释语法；也许你可以通过阅读英语来 "吸收 "它。

This seems to indicate that the prime effect of schooling imprinted on young Tom's mind was that learning requires a teacher (see: [Do we need teachers?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do_we_need_teachers%3F)). This imprint still affects Tom's thinking despite two decades of successful [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning) and extensive knowledge in a vast range of topics that have never been mentioned at school. For example, get the taste of his prognosticating brain: [Brexit will never happen](https://www.facebook.com/tomasz.szynalski/posts/1069168249840745?pnref=story). Consider that this text was written in a week after the Brexit referendum. Today it seems very accurate. Come back in 3 years to verify. This is not a kind of knowledge Tom got at school, however, his schools still get the credit for his smarts. Unjustly.

这似乎表明，学校教育在小汤姆脑海中打下的首要影响是，学习需要老师（见：我们需要老师吗）。尽管汤姆已经成功地进行了 20 年的自主学习，并广泛涉猎了大量学校从未提及的话题，但这种印记仍然影响着他的思维。比如，让他的预言大脑尝尝鲜：脱欧将永远不会发生。考虑到这篇文字是在脱欧公投后一周写的。今天看来非常准确。3 年后再来验证。这并不是汤姆在学校里得到的一种知识，然而，他的学校仍然为他的聪明立下了汗马功劳。不公正地。

### Learn drive thrives during vacation

### 学习内驱力在假期中茁壮成长

His next generalization was: *"I did not learn much during vacation. I wasn't like you, studying biochemistry for the fun of it"*. His text falsifies that claim and speaks of the impact of literature on the quality of his English:

他接下来的概括是："我在假期里没有学到什么东西。我不像你，为了好玩而学习生物化学"。他的文字证伪了这一说法，说的是文学作品对他英语素质的影响：

> During the summer vacation of 1994, I started reading books in English, mostly thrillers and sci-fi novels
>
> 
>
> 1994 年暑假期间，我开始读英文书，主要是惊险小说和科幻小说。

### Programmers are autodidacts

### 程序员都是自学成才的

Tom also attributed his programming skills to being forced to take on programming, as opposed to mindless gaming. Anyone who studies history of computing must be aware than no world-famous programmer has ever come from schooling. Programming is all about self-development and self-experimentation. So is problem solving and creativity. Tom would have taken to programming at the point when he felt the need. He might be right that he was not ready at the time of being forced. In that, he is rather lucky that school did not discourage the practice of programming.

汤姆还把自己的编程能力归结为被迫接受编程，而不是无脑的游戏。研究计算机历史的人一定知道，从来没有一个世界著名的程序员是学校教育出来的。编程就是自我发展和自我尝试。解决问题和创造力也是如此。汤姆会在他觉得有需要的时候，就会去学编程。他可能是对的，他在被强迫的时候还没有准备好。在这一点上，他是相当幸运的，学校没有阻止编程的练习。

We know that 80% of developers are self-taught and computer courses in programming have negligible impact on actual programming skills. Those who claim to have learned programming at school simply overlook the degree of self-learning required in the process. My own case is striking. Despite studying computer science for 5 years, I learned no programming at school. All my learning happened after school hours and in the years of [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning) that followed. I should add though that meeting great people in college helped me explore interesting aspects of computer science that I might have reached with years of delay.

我们知道，80% 的开发者都是自学成才的，计算机课程的编程对实际编程能力的影响可以忽略不计。那些自称在学校学过编程的人，只是忽略了在这个过程中需要自学的程度。我自己的情况就很突出。尽管我学习了 5 年的计算机科学，但我在学校没有学到任何编程知识。我所有的学习都是在课余时间和随后的几年自学中发生的。不过我应该补充的是，在大学里遇到了优秀的人，帮助我探索了计算机科学有趣的方面，而这些方面我可能会在拖延多年后才达到。

### Socialization occurs all around

### 社会化发生在身边

Tom speaks of the positive impact of competitive spirit and meeting two other great brains in high school. This is what a good school is supposed to do. His text reveals however that, to improve his English, Tom spent a great deal of time at home reading, practicing pronunciation, watching American TV, browsing dictionaries, enjoying his progress, and even adding "thousands of hours" with [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). In other words, social factor played only an important motivating role. Tom seems to overlook his own hard work and the fact that we meet great people in life in a myriad of situations, not only at school. Schools seems to provide a rich reservoir of social anecdotes only because it steals so much of youth and dominates social life of kids in modern world. Schoolers are often caught in disbelief that social life of [homeschoolers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschool) is no less rich, and usually far more satisfactory, inspirational and [fulfilling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling_socialization_is_a_non-issue). School is like your perfect wife. She seems the best in the world mostly because you never tried any other. That bias is precious in marriage. It is poisonous when evaluating the value of schooling.

汤姆讲到竞争精神的积极影响，以及在高中遇到另外两个优秀的大脑。这是一所好学校应该做的。但他的文字透露，为了提高英语水平，汤姆在家里花了大量时间阅读、练习发音、看美剧、浏览词典，享受进步，甚至用 SuperMemo 加了 "上千小时"。换句话说，社会因素只起到了重要的激励作用。汤姆似乎忽略了自己的努力，也忽略了我们在生活中遇到优秀的人，不仅是在学校，而是在各种各样的情况下。学校似乎提供了一个丰富的社会趣闻库，只因为它偷走了现代世界孩子们的太多青春，主导了他们的社会生活。学校的人常常陷入疑惑，家庭教育者的社会生活并不亚于学校的社会生活，而且通常远比学校的社会生活更令人满意、更励志、更充实。学校就像你的完美妻子。她似乎是世界上最好的，主要是因为你从未尝试过其他的。这种偏见在婚姻中是很珍贵的。在评价学校教育的价值时，它是有毒的。

## Power of mythology

## 迷思的力量

The myths that sprouted in Tom's mind as a result of impromptu [generalizations](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization) are numerous and well-documented. They can easily be falsified using Tom's own texts written with more deliberation and in a less contrarian state of mind. These are the facts:

由于即兴的泛泛而谈，在汤姆脑海中萌生的迷思有很多，而且证据确凿。用汤姆自己用比较慎重的态度和不太对立的心态写出的文字，可以很容易地证伪它们。这些都是事实：

- 8 years of schooling produced no results in English. This outcome is pretty typical: [Schools are useless in teaching English!](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schools_are_useless_in_teaching_English!)
- 8 年的学校教育在英语方面没有产生任何结果。这个结果是非常典型的：学校在英语教学中毫无用处！
- [computer gaming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Videogames) had a positive effect on English
- 电脑游戏对英语有积极作用
- computer gaming helped understand that learning can occur [without a teacher](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do_we_need_teachers%3F)
- 电脑游戏帮助了解到，学习可以在没有老师的情况下进行
- it is easy to forget how [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) gets activated in free time (e.g. during vacation)
- 很容易忘记学习内驱力是如何在空闲时间被激活的（例如在假期）
- progress in English requires thousands of hours of [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning)
- 英语的进步需要数千小时的自学
- [self-learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning) is essential for mastering programming skills
- 自学是掌握编程技能的必要条件
- by virtue of school's dominance over social life of youth, it is easy to overestimate the value of school in sparking [social interaction](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Socialization) with other smart brains
- 由于学校对青少年社会生活的主导地位，很容易高估学校在激发与其他聪明大脑的社会互动方面的价值

Tom started reading [my book](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_schooling) from a wrong end, and instantly arrived at wrong conclusions. This is why in all texts, I try to put most emphasis on the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive), the [pleasure of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning), and the [Fundamental law of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning).

汤姆从一个错误的端倪开始读我的书，瞬间得出了错误的结论。这就是为什么在所有的文字中，我尽量把最强调的是学习内驱力，学习的乐趣，以及学习的基本规律。

For people like [Bill Gates](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_is_wrong_about_education), or [Martha Albertson Fineman](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling) or Tom, the education system provides an illusion that it works. It is easy to overlook the fact that most of the credit goes to kids' brains, and very little is attributable to the system. This is how smart people and good schools slow down the transition to the only rational system outlined in my [Grand Education Reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Education_Reform).

对于像比尔-盖茨，或者玛莎-艾伯顿-芬曼或汤姆这样的人来说，教育系统提供了一种错觉，认为它是有效的。人们很容易忽视这样一个事实，即大部分功劳都归功于孩子们的大脑，而归功于制度的很少。这就是聪明人和好学校如何减缓向我的《教育大改革》中所概述的唯一合理制度的过渡。
