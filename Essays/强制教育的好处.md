# Advantages of compulsory education 义务教育的好处

## Future of compulsory education 

## 义务教育的未来

[Compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) has no future. It is a modern form of child slavery. Children know it, many adults know it. The system survives by lazy convenience, systemic inertia, and the force of habit. I list the main advantages of [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) in this text: [Compulsory schooling must end](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end).

义务教育没有前途。这是现代的儿童奴役。孩子们知道，很多成年人也知道。这个系统所以能维系，懒惰的便利、惰性和习惯生存下来。我在这篇文章中列出了自由学习的主要好处：义务教育必须结束。

Here, for symmetry, I try to list the advantages of compulsory education. If I missed any benefit due to my bias, please [let me know](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak).

在这里，为了对称起见，我试着列出义务教育的好处。如果我因为偏见错过了任何好处，请告诉我。

Compulsory schooling has no place in modern societies

义务教育在现代社会是没有立足之地的。

## No advantage can override human rights

## 没有任何好处可以凌驾于人权之上

[Compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) is a violation of human rights. I can list many advantages of mandatory education, but they mean little. Human rights should be protected independently. Equally well, we could argue the "advantages" of slavery such as "cheap labor". In this text, I will try to compile the "advantages" of coercion as seen by others. Those advantages are largely based on myths. Compulsory schooling has a disastrous impact on mental health, [intelligence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence), and even the overall level of high quality knowledge in society. See: [Children’s Freedom: A Human Rights Perspective](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Children’s_Freedom:_A_Human_Rights_Perspective)

义务教育是对人权的侵犯。我可以列举义务教育的许多优点，但它们的意义不大。人权应该得到独立的保护。我们同样可以指出奴隶制的“好处”，比如“廉价劳动力”。在这篇文章中，我将试着整理别人所看到的胁迫教育的“好处”。这些好处在很大程度上是基于迷死。义务教育对心理健康、智力乃至整个社会的高质量知识水平都产生了灾难性的影响。请参阅：儿童自由：人权视角

## Eliminating illiteracy

## 扫除文盲

Most people support [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) on the grounds that it keeps societies literate. That impact on literacy is a myth. Education system does not need to be compulsory to fulfill its role. Illiteracy programs may be independent of the core education system. Most of all, if we look at societies before compulsory education, the literacy rates were pretty impressive in the light of much worse access to the sources of knowledge as compared with modern societies. In less developed countries, the education is a privilege, and there is no need to mar the privilege with coercion. For contrast see: [Hole in the wall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Hole_in_the_wall)

大多数人支持义务教育的理由是它减少社会的文盲率。这种对识字率的影响是迷思。教育制度发挥作用的前提不应是强制性的，而扫盲计划应当与核心教育体系分开。不仅如此，考察以前没有义务教育的社会，其识字率低下的根源在于，相比现代社会，那时知识的获取更加困难。在欠发达国家，教育如同久旱甘霖，不应以胁迫强制使其逊色。对照看：墙上的洞

## Help for the less privileged

## 帮助弱势群体

The only legitimate advantage of the [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) is that it has some positive impact on families hovering at the cultural bottom of the educational ladder. In a pathological family, coercive state can indeed rip a child from a toxic environment and place it at school with some semblance of normalcy. However, instead of forcing the whole population to take a medicine that is supposed to help a small minority, we should rather look for programs that would assist less fortunate families and prevent child abuse. Those programs or institutions may be molded in a shape similar to those that are aimed at preventing family violence, alcoholism, drug addiction, child labor, etc.

义务教育的唯一合理优势，是对接受教育困难的家庭的积极影响。国家力量确实可以强制让孩子脱离病态家庭中有毒的环境，让他在学校里过上更接近正常的生活。然而对这种少数家庭的帮助不应泛化套在到所有人身上，我们应该让帮助不幸家庭和避免虐待儿童的项目完成这项工作。建立这些项目或机构时，可以参考预防家庭暴力、帮助酗酒者、瘾君子、减少童工等项目或机构。

In modern societies, a vast majority of families show a degree of care about educational outcome for their children. Where that care is insufficient, it cannot easily be remedied by mandatory education. The cases of the Amish in the US or the Gypsy in Europe show that culture determines the outcome, and the intervention of the state often makes things worse.

在现代社会，绝大多数家庭都多少关心孩子的教育成就。如果家庭关心不足，义务教育也难以补救。美国的阿米什人，欧洲的吉普赛人表明，文化决定教育成就，而政府的干预往往适得其反。

We have built a feedback loop in which coercion increases the hate of learning, which increases the need for coercion. Instead, we should start a positive feedback loop of [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning), cultural change, and value put on education in society. This is the most efficient evolutionary approach towards a brighter future.

义务教育是正反馈，胁迫增加了对学习的厌恶，进而滋生更多胁迫。由此，我们应该启动一个积极的反馈循环，包括自由学习，移风易俗，以及社会对教育的价值。这是通向光明未来的最有效的进化方法。

## Enforcing learning discipline、

## 加强学习纪律

My claim that kids should go to school healthy and refreshed seems obvious. However, when I mention the need to avoid [early waking](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alarm_clock), I hear that skipping classes would result in building up outstanding work. This is a cultural effect of the decades under the yoke of [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling). In the coercive system, all knowledge is measured in portions of [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum), and kids are whipped to speed to make sure they [cram](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming) all areas of knowledge in time. The associated stress affects kids, teachers, parents, principals and above. In the end, after a while, the [retention](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retention) of knowledge is close to zero. It is like whipping a dead horse: the less he moves the harder we whip. Efficient learning must be [self-paced](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-paced). In addition it should [self-directed](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed). In other words, it must be free. We inflict torture on young minds in return for little knowledge and catastrophic mental toll.

我曾提出孩子们应该健康、精神饱满地去上学，这似乎很显然。然而，我一旦提到要避免早早叫起孩子，人们就反讽地回答，翘课使人杰出。这是几十年来义务教育枷锁下的文化效应。在胁迫性系统中，所有的知识被切分成课程表的格子，孩子们被鞭策着提高速度，以确保他们及时背下所有课程的知识。由此滋生的压力波及到孩子，老师，家长，校长以及高层。最终，只消一点时间，知识的保留率便接近于零。这就像鞭打死马：马动得越少，我们鞭打的力度就越大。有效的学习一定是自定进度的，自我导向的。换句话说，它必须是自由的。我们折磨年轻人，结果他们记不住知识，精神受到灾难性的损伤。

## Eliminating fears of unpreparedness

## 消除对未做好准备的恐惧

Compulsory education seems to reassure parents that their kids will get well prepared for adulthood. In reality, voluntary and diversified education is the best way to reassure harmonious redistribution of knowledge and skill resources in society. The mere act of eliminating the mandate will spark [diversification](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Diversity). This in turn will dilute the illusory age-based cultural standard of what a young man should know at any stage of development. When comparison yardsticks disperse, so will the anxieties based on the tempo of progress and direction of development.

义务教育似乎让父母放心，他们的孩子会为成年做好准备。但实际上，自愿参与而多样化的教育，才是传播知识与技能的最佳方法。仅是取消这一强制措施，多元化便得到发展空间，进而消解并一种不实际的年龄中心的价值观，即孩子在每个年龄段都必须学会相应内容。没有了比较的尺度，基于前进节奏和发展方向的焦虑也无影无踪。


## Eliminating social chaos

## 消除社会混乱

Fears of social chaos are often listed by less informed adults as a good reason for keeping [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) in place.

对社会混乱的恐惧，对不了解相关方面的成年人来说，是实行义务教育的好理由。

One of my 6-year-old friends introduced me to his granny. I asked about her comments on the value of the abolition of "school slavery". The lady responded with:

我的一个 6 岁的朋友把我介绍给他的奶奶。我问她对废除“学校奴隶制”的价值有何评论，这位女士回答说：

> Freedom of learning would turn society into a jungle
>
> 自由地学习会把社会变成丛林

I asked the venerable lady to elaborate. However, she was too upset to explain her point of view. She compared my thinking in turn to Lenin and then to Hitler. Ironically, [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) plays far bigger a role in totalitarian systems (see [Soviet](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy), and [North Korean](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Utopian_visions:_Education_via-a-vis_North_Korea) examples). She suggested that *"Lenin wanted to keep workers dumb"*, while Lenin's ideas on education were actually pretty reasonable. He instituted a successful program for combating illiteracy that was rampant in Russia and the territories of the USSR in the early 1920s.

我请这位可敬的女士详细说明，然而，她太受冲击，无法解释自己的观点。她把我的思想依次比作列宁和希特勒。讽刺的是，义务教育在极权制度中更加重要(参见苏联和朝鲜的例子)。她说“列宁希望工人一直是笨蛋”，然而列宁对教育的想法实际上是相当合理的。他开发了一个成功的扫除文盲的计划，这一计划在 20 世纪 20 年代初在俄罗斯和苏联如火如荼。

I presume, the lady has no belief in the goodness of human nature. Like many other proponents of [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling), she likely believes that all goodness, and the social rules must be inculcated in young minds by systematic indoctrination.

我估计，这位女士不相信人性本善。其他许多义务教育的支持者和她一样，认为所有的品德和社会规则，都必须通过系统性填鸭来塞进年轻人的脑中。

This is an eternal conflict between the contrasting views on the inner human nature. Are we innately good? Christian conservatives with Biblical beliefs in the original sin may say *"Welcome, Junior, to the brave new world where you have a guaranteed income, sex with anybody, and the teacher may not burden you with anything that doesn’t strike your fancy. You will grow up to be an amoral, ignorant monster"* ([source](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/The_journey_of_John_Holt)).

这是两种截然不同的人性观之间的永恒冲突。我们天生就是好人吗？相信“圣经”原罪说的基督教保守派可能会说：*“欢迎来到这个美丽的新世界，孩子，在那里你有有保障的收入，和任何人发生性关系，老师不会给用不合你心意的东西烦你。你长大后会成为不道德而无知的怪物*”(来源)。

Today, using neuroscience, game theory, and information theory, we can confidently state that humans are predominantly "good" (see: [Optimal socialization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimal_socialization) and [Goodness of knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Goodness_of_knowledge)).

今天，运用神经科学、博弈论和信息论，我们可以自信地指出，人类主要是“善”的(参见：知识的最佳社会化和善)。

## Preventing child abuse

## 防止虐待儿童

Child abuse and family violence should be tackled by dedicated programs or agencies. There is no need to steal long hours of kid's life every day just to check if they are ok. [This Fox News article](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Child_abuse_in_the_guise_of_homeschooling) can be summarized as "abusive parents commit horrific acts under the guise of homeschooling". We all know that "abusive husbands commit horrific acts under the guise of woman's freedom to stay at home". Child abuse is a crime and should be treated as such.

儿童虐待和家庭暴力应该由专门的项目或机构来解决。强占儿童大量时间，只为确保他们没有问题的做法，没有必要。一篇福克斯新闻的文章可以概括为“虐待狂父母打着在家上学的幌子做出可怖行为”。我们都知道，“施虐的丈夫打着妇女留在家里的自由的幌子做出可怕的行为”，不等同于妇女应该集中起来以“确保安全”。虐待儿童是犯罪，应该相应对待。

**We cannot punish the whole population of children for the future potential crimes of a minority of parents**!

**我们不能因为少数家长未来可能犯下的罪行而让全体儿童受罪！**

## Free meals for children

## 儿童免费用餐

If free meals for children are to be used as an argument for [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling), they may as well be considered an advantage to spending time in prison. Some people do actually see prison as a nice escape from homelessness. If communities want to improve child nutrition, they should work on programs dedicated to the goal. Those programs do not need to be tacked to enslavement, and should never be compulsory. School cafeterias are not a shining example of healthy eating, and it is a crime to make a health-conscious child toss a decent meal to garbage. Good hearts can also produce tragicomic freak outcomes: [Offer of school meals with a threat of foster care](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Offer_of_school_meals_with_a_threat_of_foster_care).

如果提供免费用餐是支持义务教育的理由，那么同样也能用于支持在监狱服役。有些人确实认为，监狱对无家可归的人来说是个好去处。如果社区想要改善儿童营养状况，他们应该扶持相关项目，而这些计划不用附加在圈养奴役上，而且永远不应该是义务性的。学校自助餐厅并不是健康饮食的优秀典范，让一个注重健康的孩子把像样的饭菜扔进垃圾是一种犯罪。善良的心也会产生悲喜交加的怪诞结果：学校提供的膳食威胁到寄养家庭。

## Benefits of imprisonment

## 监禁的好处

The whole set of advantages listed for [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) could also be listed for adult imprisonment (e.g for the purpose of [mandatory adult education](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mandatory_adult_education)). Prisoners could spend most of their time in classrooms or in a library, their lives could be well-organized by prison authority, homeless prisoners would benefit in shelter and nutrition, etc. The list of benefits would match the list of benefits of [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) item by item. The reason why we consider adult imprisonment preposterous is that no such "beneficial" proposition would ever stand the test of democracy. In contrast, [school is prison](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_is_prison) for many children who cannot vote. [Children should have the right to vote](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Children_should_have_the_right_to_vote). At the very least, they should have a decisive vote on their own education and their goals in life.

为义务教育列出的一整套好处也同样是成人监禁的好处(例如，出于义务性成人教育的目的)。囚犯可以在教室或图书馆度过他们的大部分时间，监狱当局可以很好地安排他们的生活，无家可归的囚犯将在收容所和营养方面受益，等等。福利清单将逐项与义务教育福利清单相匹配。我们之所以认为成人监禁是荒谬的，是因为这样的“有益”主张经不起民主的考验。相比之下，学校是孩子的监狱，这些孩子不能投票。至少，他们应对自己的教育和人生目标投出决定性的一票。
