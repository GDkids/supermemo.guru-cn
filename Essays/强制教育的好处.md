# Advantages of compulsory education 强制教育的好处

## Future of compulsory education 

## 强制教育的未来

[Compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) has no future. It is a modern form of child slavery. Children know it, many adults know it. The system survives by lazy convenience, systemic inertia, and the force of habit. I list the main advantages of [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) in this text: [Compulsory schooling must end](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end).

强制教育是没有前途的。这是一种现代形式的儿童奴役。孩子们知道，很多成年人也知道。这个系统靠懒惰的便利、系统的惰性和习惯的力量生存下来。我在这篇文章中列出了自由学习的主要好处：强制教育必须结束。

Here, for symmetry, I try to list the advantages of compulsory education. If I missed any benefit due to my bias, please [let me know](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak).

在这里，为了对称起见，我试着列出强制教育的好处。如果我因为偏见错过了任何好处，请告诉我。

Compulsory schooling has no place in modern societies

强制教育在现代社会是没有立足之地的。

## No advantage can override human rights

## 没有任何好处可以凌驾于人权之上

[Compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) is a violation of human rights. I can list many advantages of mandatory education, but they mean little. Human rights should be protected independently. Equally well, we could argue the "advantages" of slavery such as "cheap labor". In this text, I will try to compile the "advantages" of coercion as seen by others. Those advantages are largely based on myths. Compulsory schooling has a disastrous impact on mental health, [intelligence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence), and even the overall level of high quality knowledge in society. See: [Children’s Freedom: A Human Rights Perspective](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Children’s_Freedom:_A_Human_Rights_Perspective)

强制教育是对人权的侵犯。我可以列举强制教育的许多优点，但它们的意义不大。人权应该得到独立的保护。同样好的是，我们可以争论奴隶制的“好处”，比如“廉价劳动力”。在这篇文章中，我将试着整理一下别人所看到的强制的“好处”。这些好处在很大程度上是基于神话。强制教育对心理健康、智力乃至整个社会的高质量知识水平都产生了灾难性的影响。请参阅：儿童自由：人权视角

## Eliminating illiteracy

## 扫除文盲

Most people support [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) on the grounds that it keeps societies literate. That impact on literacy is a myth. Education system does not need to be compulsory to fulfill its role. Illiteracy programs may be independent of the core education system. Most of all, if we look at societies before compulsory education, the literacy rates were pretty impressive in the light of much worse access to the sources of knowledge as compared with modern societies. In less developed countries, the education is a privilege, and there is no need to mar the privilege with coercion. For contrast see: [Hole in the wall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Hole_in_the_wall)

大多数人支持强制教育，理由是它能使社会保持识字能力。这种对识字率的影响是一个神话。教育制度不需要强制性地去履行它的作用。文盲项目可以独立于核心教育体系。最重要的是，如果我们看看强制教育之前的社会，识字率是相当令人印象深刻的，因为与现代社会相比，获取知识的渠道要差得多。在欠发达国家，教育是一种特权，没有必要用强制来破坏这种特权。对照看：墙上的洞

## Help for the less privileged

## 为弱势群体提供帮助

The only legitimate advantage of the [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) is that it has some positive impact on families hovering at the cultural bottom of the educational ladder. In a pathological family, coercive state can indeed rip a child from a toxic environment and place it at school with some semblance of normalcy. However, instead of forcing the whole population to take a medicine that is supposed to help a small minority, we should rather look for programs that would assist less fortunate families and prevent child abuse. Those programs or institutions may be molded in a shape similar to those that are aimed at preventing family violence, alcoholism, drug addiction, child labor, etc.

强制教育的唯一合法好处是，它对处于教育阶梯文化底层的家庭有一些积极的影响。在一个病态的家庭里，强制性的国家确实可以把一个孩子从一个有毒的环境中拉出来，让他在学校里过上正常的生活。然而，与其强制所有人服用本应帮助少数人的药物，我们更应该寻求帮助不幸家庭和防止虐待儿童的项目。这些项目或机构的形式可以与旨在防止家庭暴力、酗酒、吸毒成瘾、童工等的项目或机构相似。

In modern societies, a vast majority of families show a degree of care about educational outcome for their children. Where that care is insufficient, it cannot easily be remedied by mandatory education. The cases of the Amish in the US or the Gypsy in Europe show that culture determines the outcome, and the intervention of the state often makes things worse.

在现代社会，绝大多数家庭都在一定程度上关心孩子的教育结果。如果这种照顾不足，就很难通过强制教育来补救。美国的阿米什人或欧洲的吉普赛人的例子表明，文化决定了结果，而政府的干预往往会使事情变得更糟。

We have built a feedback loop in which coercion increases the hate of learning, which increases the need for coercion. Instead, we should start a positive feedback loop of [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning), cultural change, and value put on education in society. This is the most efficient evolutionary approach towards a brighter future.

我们已经建立了一个反馈循环，强制增加了对学习的厌恶，从而增加了对强制的需求。相反，我们应该开始一个积极的反馈循环，自由学习，文化改变，以及社会对教育的价值。这是通向光明未来的最有效的进化方法。

## Enforcing learning discipline、

## 加强学习纪律

My claim that kids should go to school healthy and refreshed seems obvious. However, when I mention the need to avoid [early waking](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alarm_clock), I hear that skipping classes would result in building up outstanding work. This is a cultural effect of the decades under the yoke of [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling). In the coercive system, all knowledge is measured in portions of [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum), and kids are whipped to speed to make sure they [cram](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming) all areas of knowledge in time. The associated stress affects kids, teachers, parents, principals and above. In the end, after a while, the [retention](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retention) of knowledge is close to zero. It is like whipping a dead horse: the less he moves the harder we whip. Efficient learning must be [self-paced](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-paced). In addition it should [self-directed](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed). In other words, it must be free. We inflict torture on young minds in return for little knowledge and catastrophic mental toll.

我关于孩子们应该健康、精神饱满地去上学的主张似乎很明显。然而，当我提到要避免早起的时候，我听说逃课会导致出色的工作。这是几十年来强制教育枷锁下的文化效应。在强制系统中，所有的知识都是按照课程的部分来衡量的，孩子们被鞭策着加快速度，以确保他们及时灌输所有领域的知识。相关的压力影响到孩子、老师、家长、校长及以上。最后，过了一段时间，知识的保留率接近于零。这就像鞭打死马：他动得越少，我们鞭打的力度就越大。有效的学习必须是自定进度的。此外，它应该是自我导向的。换句话说，它必须是自由的。我们对年轻人的思想施加折磨，以换取知识匮乏和灾难性的精神损失。

## Eliminating fears of unpreparedness

## 消除对未做好准备的恐惧

Compulsory education seems to reassure parents that their kids will get well prepared for adulthood. In reality, voluntary and diversified education is the best way to reassure harmonious redistribution of knowledge and skill resources in society. The mere act of eliminating the mandate will spark [diversification](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Diversity). This in turn will dilute the illusory age-based cultural standard of what a young man should know at any stage of development. When comparison yardsticks disperse, so will the anxieties based on the tempo of progress and direction of development.

强制教育似乎让父母放心，他们的孩子会为成年做好准备。在现实中，自愿和多样化的教育是保证知识和技能资源在社会上和谐再分配的最好方式。仅仅是取消这一命令，就会引发多元化。这反过来又会冲淡以年龄为基础的虚幻的文化标准，即年轻人在任何发展阶段都应该知道什么。比较尺度散了，基于前进节奏和发展方向的焦虑也就散了。

## Eliminating social chaos

## 消除社会混乱

Fears of social chaos are often listed by less informed adults as a good reason for keeping [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) in place.

对社会混乱的恐惧经常被信息较少的成年人列为保持强制教育的一个很好的理由。

One of my 6-year-old friends introduced me to his granny. I asked about her comments on the value of the abolition of "school slavery". The lady responded with:

我的一个 6 岁的朋友把我介绍给他的奶奶。我问她对废除“学校奴隶制”的价值有何评论。这位女士回答说：

> Freedom of learning would turn society into a jungle
>
> 学习自由会把社会变成丛林

I asked the venerable lady to elaborate. However, she was too upset to explain her point of view. She compared my thinking in turn to Lenin and then to Hitler. Ironically, [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) plays far bigger a role in totalitarian systems (see [Soviet](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy), and [North Korean](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Utopian_visions:_Education_via-a-vis_North_Korea) examples). She suggested that *"Lenin wanted to keep workers dumb"*, while Lenin's ideas on education were actually pretty reasonable. He instituted a successful program for combating illiteracy that was rampant in Russia and the territories of the USSR in the early 1920s.

我请这位可敬的女士详细说明。然而，她太沮丧了，无法解释自己的观点。她把我的思想依次比作列宁，然后又比作希特勒。具有讽刺意味的是，强制教育在极权制度中扮演着更重要的角色(参见苏联和朝鲜的例子)。她说“列宁想让工人保持沉默”，而列宁关于教育的想法实际上是相当合理的。他制定了一个成功的扫除文盲的计划，这一计划在 20 世纪 20 年代初在俄罗斯和苏联领土上蔓延。

I presume, the lady has no belief in the goodness of human nature. Like many other proponents of [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling), she likely believes that all goodness, and the social rules must be inculcated in young minds by systematic indoctrination.

我想，这位女士不相信人性的善良。像其他许多强制教育的支持者一样，她很可能相信，所有的善和社会规则都必须通过系统的灌输来灌输给年轻人。

This is an eternal conflict between the contrasting views on the inner human nature. Are we innately good? Christian conservatives with Biblical beliefs in the original sin may say *"Welcome, Junior, to the brave new world where you have a guaranteed income, sex with anybody, and the teacher may not burden you with anything that doesn’t strike your fancy. You will grow up to be an amoral, ignorant monster"* ([source](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/The_journey_of_John_Holt)).

这是两种截然不同的人性观之间的永恒冲突。我们天生就是好人吗？对“圣经”原罪抱有信仰的基督教保守派可能会说：*“欢迎来到这个美丽的新世界，孩子，在那里你有有保障的收入，和任何人发生性关系，老师可能不会给你带来任何不合你心意的负担。你长大后会成为一个不道德、无知的怪物*”(来源)。

Today, using neuroscience, game theory, and information theory, we can confidently state that humans are predominantly "good" (see: [Optimal socialization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimal_socialization) and [Goodness of knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Goodness_of_knowledge)).

今天，运用神经科学、博弈论和信息论，我们可以自信地指出，人类主要是“善”的(参见：知识的最佳社会化和善)。

## Preventing child abuse

## 防止虐待儿童

Child abuse and family violence should be tackled by dedicated programs or agencies. There is no need to steal long hours of kid's life every day just to check if they are ok. [This Fox News article](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Child_abuse_in_the_guise_of_homeschooling) can be summarized as "abusive parents commit horrific acts under the guise of homeschooling". We all know that "abusive husbands commit horrific acts under the guise of woman's freedom to stay at home". Child abuse is a crime and should be treated as such.

虐待儿童和家庭暴力应该由专门的项目或机构来解决。没有必要每天花很长时间去窃取孩子的生活，只是为了检查他们是否还好。福克斯新闻的这篇文章可以概括为“虐待的父母打着在家上学的幌子做出可怕的行为”。我们都知道，“施虐的丈夫打着妇女留在家里的自由的幌子做出可怕的行为”。虐待儿童是一种犯罪，应该按照犯罪对待。

**We cannot punish the whole population of children for the future potential crimes of a minority of parents**!

**我们不能因为少数家长未来可能犯下的罪行而惩罚全体儿童！**

## Free meals for children

## 儿童免费用餐

If free meals for children are to be used as an argument for [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling), they may as well be considered an advantage to spending time in prison. Some people do actually see prison as a nice escape from homelessness. If communities want to improve child nutrition, they should work on programs dedicated to the goal. Those programs do not need to be tacked to enslavement, and should never be compulsory. School cafeterias are not a shining example of healthy eating, and it is a crime to make a health-conscious child toss a decent meal to garbage. Good hearts can also produce tragicomic freak outcomes: [Offer of school meals with a threat of foster care](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Offer_of_school_meals_with_a_threat_of_foster_care).

如果儿童免费用餐被用来作为强制教育的理由，那么它们也可以被认为是在监狱里度过时间的好处。有些人确实认为监狱是摆脱无家可归的一种很好的方式。如果社区想要改善儿童营养，他们应该致力于实现这一目标的项目。这些计划不需要附加到奴役上，而且永远不应该是强制性的。学校自助餐厅并不是健康饮食的光辉典范，让一个注重健康的孩子把像样的饭菜扔进垃圾是一种犯罪。善良的心也会产生悲喜交加的怪诞结果：学校提供的膳食威胁到寄养家庭。

## Benefits of imprisonment

## 监禁的好处

The whole set of advantages listed for [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) could also be listed for adult imprisonment (e.g for the purpose of [mandatory adult education](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mandatory_adult_education)). Prisoners could spend most of their time in classrooms or in a library, their lives could be well-organized by prison authority, homeless prisoners would benefit in shelter and nutrition, etc. The list of benefits would match the list of benefits of [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) item by item. The reason why we consider adult imprisonment preposterous is that no such "beneficial" proposition would ever stand the test of democracy. In contrast, [school is prison](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_is_prison) for many children who cannot vote. [Children should have the right to vote](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Children_should_have_the_right_to_vote). At the very least, they should have a decisive vote on their own education and their goals in life.

为强制教育列出的一整套好处也可以被列为成人监禁的好处(例如，出于强制性成人教育的目的)。囚犯可以在教室或图书馆度过他们的大部分时间，监狱当局可以很好地安排他们的生活，无家可归的囚犯将在收容所和营养方面受益，等等。福利清单将逐项与强制教育福利清单相匹配。我们之所以认为成人监禁是荒谬的，是因为这样的“有益”主张经不起民主的考验。相比之下，学校是许多不能投票的孩子的监狱。孩子们应该有投票权。至少，他们应该对自己的教育和人生目标拥有决定性的一票。
