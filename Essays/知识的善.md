## Is knowledge "good" or "neutral"?

## 知识是“善的”还是“中性的”？

This article tries to argue that more knowledge leads to statistically more *"goodness"*, and that this holds true to most definitions of *"goodness"*. This implies that knowledge can be a remedy against *"evil"*.

本文试图论证，更多的知识导致统计上更多的“善”，这适用于“善”的大多数定义。这意味着知识可以成为对抗“邪恶”的一种补救方法。

Even if you are the most evil of all sinners, you will cross over all evil on the raft of knowledge. Bhagavad-Gita (~2-3rd century AD, Chapter 4: Knowledge)

即使你是所有罪人中最邪恶的，你也会在知识的木筏上渡过所有的邪恶。博伽梵歌塔(公元2-3世纪，第4章：知识)

## Introduction

## 引言

Even though I am no philosopher or religious scholar, I feel compelled to address the issue of "goodness of knowledge". My whole professional life has been spent on looking for ways towards faster and better learning. However, I heard some voices that better learning does not necessarily lead to more good or less evil. Exemplary opinions that sparked this article are: *"If you help a terrorist learn faster, it will lead to more death and destruction"* or *"Your [SuperMemo learning method](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) only accelerates the rat race by raising the bar for students who are already on the verge of a breakdown"*. Comrade Joseph Stalin insisted: *"Education is a weapon, whose effect depends on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed"*.

虽然我不是哲学家，也不是宗教学者，但我觉得有必要谈一谈“知识的善”这个问题。我的整个职业生涯都花在寻找更快更好的学习方法上。然而，我听到一些声音说，更好的学习并不一定会带来更多的善或更少的恶。引发这篇文章的典型观点是：“如果你帮助恐怖分子学得更快，就会导致更多的死亡和破坏”，或者“你的 SuperMemo 学习方法只会提高已经濒临崩溃的学生的门槛，从而加速了激烈的竞争”。斯大林同志坚持说：“教育是一件武器，它的效果取决于他手中拿着的是谁，瞄准的是谁。”

Naturally, it is true that learning can lead to better weapons of mass destruction. It is also true that methods of accelerated learning will also accelerate the negative aspects of the race for doing more in less time. It is true that education may become indoctrination. However, in this article, I would like to demonstrate that knowledge is "statistically good".

当然，学习可以带来更好的大规模杀伤性武器，这是事实。同样真实的是，加速学习的方法也会加速用更少的时间做更多事情的竞赛的消极方面。的确，教育可以变成灌输。然而，在这篇文章中，我想证明知识“在统计上是好的”。

Many people believe knowledge is neutral. Its goodness or badness is determined by the way it is used. The "neutral" view of knowledge, however, does not emphasize the important fact that the more we know the more likely we are to act and do good. In other words, knowledge can be used for both good and evil, however, if we employ the tools of statistics or probability we will easily show that knowledge is overwhelmingly "good".

许多人认为知识是中性的。它的好坏取决于它的使用方式。然而，知识的“中性”观点并没有强调一个重要的事实，即我们知道的越多，我们就越有可能采取行动并做好事。换句话说，知识既可以用来做好事，也可以用来做坏事，然而，如果我们使用统计或概率的工具，我们会很容易地表明知识是压倒性的“善”。

## Goodness of knowledge

## 知识的善

My claim that knowledge is good originates from this simple five-step reasoning:

1. there is one truth
2. knowledge helps reveal the truth
3. the truth about goodness is no different than other truths; i.e. with more knowledge, we are more likely to agree what is true and what is good
4. knowledge must, therefore, act as a universal unifier of value systems across all philosophical and religious systems
5. knowledge is thus increasing the chances we will act "good" to the best of our understanding of what "good" is

我所说的知识是善的，源于这个简单的五步推理：

1. 有一个真理
2. 知识有助于揭示真理
3. 关于善的真理与其他真理没有什么不同；也就是说，知识越多，我们就越有可能同意什么是真的，什么是善的
4. 因此，知识必须作为所有哲学和宗教体系的价值体系的普遍统一体。
5. 因此，知识增加了我们在理解什么是“善”的情况下表现“善”的机会。

Naturally, without a formal proof, the above thinking will easily be undermined by a misconceived use of Gödel's proof, contradictory quotes from the scriptures, arguments of relativistic goodness, Moore's open question, non-cognitivistic theories of value, etc. Some people abhor globalization and homogenization of the mankind; however, the convergence of educated minds towards the only truth, including the truth about value, is inevitable (as shown formally by information theory). This convergence is a welcome way of minimizing social and national conflict. Reconciliation of the systems of value is good news for democracy and helps overcome its weaknesses. By getting into more explanations and examples, I run the risk of being compared to Hitler, Satan, Stalin or Osama. That risk comes along the sensitive nature of the subject where views differ drastically, and minor nuances of terminology lead to major outbursts of adrenaline. Philosophy of ethics is like political philosophy. For one person, communism is "murder everywhere always", and for another is the highest ideal of utilitarian attitude. One can see communism as an immoral way of the inept living off the competent. Another one can see it as the brain-like central control system optimizing redistribution of resources using the same criteria as the human body: more for those organs that need it more. When they hear the word "communism", some people visualize dead corpses of the Stalinist regime, others see their own family where parents and kids all share and work for the common good. In this short text, I can only hope to convey my thinking without ever convincing those who take a hard-line opposite skeptical view. Below I will elaborate in some detail on the concept of one truth, one goodness, and the convergence of the systems of values.

当然，如果没有正式的证明，上述思维很容易被误用哥德尔的证明、自相矛盾的经文、相对论善的争论、摩尔的开放问题、非认知主义的价值论等所破坏。一些人憎恶人类的全球化和同质化；然而，受过教育的人向唯一的真理趋同，包括关于价值的真理，是不可避免的(信息论正式表明了这一点)。这种趋同是将社会和国家冲突降至最低的一种受欢迎的方式。价值体系的协调对民主来说是个好消息，有助于克服其弱点。通过更多的解释和例子，我冒着被拿来与希特勒、撒旦、斯大林或奥萨马相提并论的风险。这种风险伴随着这个主题的敏感性质而来，那里的观点截然不同，术语上的细微差别会导致肾上腺素的大量释放。伦理哲学就像政治哲学。对一个人来说，共产主义是“无处不在的杀戮”；对另一个人来说，共产主义是功利主义的最高理想。人们可以认为共产主义是无能的人靠能者为生的不道德的方式。另一个人可以将其视为类似大脑的中央控制系统，使用与人体相同的标准来优化资源的重新分配：更多地分配给那些更需要它的器官。当他们听到“共产主义”这个词时，一些人会想到斯大林政权的死尸，另一些人会看到他们自己的家庭，父母和孩子都在那里分享和为公共利益工作。在这短短的文本中，我只能希望传达我的想法，而不能说服那些持强硬相反怀疑观点的人。下面我将详细阐述一个真理、一个善的概念，以及价值体系的趋同。

## One truth premise

## 一个真理前提

Instinctively we go through life by the premise that there is only one truth. If we see an elephant and someone else denies it, we assume he or she is confused, misinformed, or lying. The *one truth* premise is wired into the inductive powers of our neural networks who daily generalize experience and build a consistent model of the surrounding world. From birth, we build a set of theorems about the reality deriving it all from the hard-wired neural axiom that what we get on the input of our senses is more or less true. Naturally, our model of reality can be false if our *correct input* axiom is false. Here are some examples where "our reality" might appear to be a "false reality":

本能地，我们生活在只有一个真理的前提下。如果我们看到一头大象，而其他人否认了，我们就认为他或她是迷惑了、误导了或撒谎了。一个真理前提与我们的神经网络的归纳能力相连，这些神经网络每天总结经验并建立一个关于周围世界的一致模型。从出生起，我们就建立了一套关于现实的定理，这些定理都来自于硬连线的神经公理，即我们从感官输入中得到的东西或多或少是真实的。当然，如果我们正确的输入公理是错误的，那么我们的现实模型可能是错误的。以下是一些“我们的现实”可能看起来是“虚假现实”的例子：

- we wake up one day to discover that "our reality" is just a dream and the "real reality" is based on different physics or different logic or ... things we cannot even imagine within our reality
- our reality is being simulated on the computer that lives in another reality (scenario taken from the movie *"Matrix"*)
- our brain is suspended in a vat with artificially controlled input that provides false sensory impressions
- 有一天我们醒来，发现“我们的现实”只是一个梦，而“真实的现实”是基于不同的物理或不同的逻辑或…我们在现实中无法想象的事情
- 我们的现实被模拟在生活在另一个现实中的计算机上(场景选自电影“黑客帝国”)
- 我们的大脑悬浮在一个有人工控制的输入的大桶里，提供错误的感觉印象

Whatever the true reality is, we have currently no way of escaping the present one. In other words, we have no choice but to accept the correct input axiom and live as if our reality model was the correct one.

不管真实的现实是什么，我们目前都没有办法逃避现在的现实。换句话说，我们别无选择，只能接受正确的输入公理，就像我们的现实模型是正确的那样生活。

"Our reality" presents itself as roughly the same reality to all of us. In other words, we (rational) all believe we live on the planet Earth that makes part of the Solar System in Milky Way. We are made of organs, tissues, and cells. We feel and reason similarly. We preponderantly use the same rules of logic. Our logic tells us that if the Earth is closer to the Sun than Mars then the Earth cannot, at the same time, be further from the Sun. One correctly formulated statement on truth cannot be true and false at the same time. Liar's paradox is not "correctly formulated" and hence proves nothing against *one truth* premise. *"This sentence cannot be proven correct"* is self-referential and does not contribute to the set of true theorems about reality. *"This sweater is red"* might appear true or false if we consider daltonism or a simple matter of taste, however, the true spectrum of light reflected by the sweater can be measured. It is the spectrum that makes the truth not the perception of redness.

“我们的现实”以大致相同的现实呈现给我们所有人。换句话说，我们(理性的)都相信我们生活在构成银河系太阳系一部分的地球上。我们是由器官、组织和细胞组成的。我们的感受和推理都是一样的。我们主要使用相同的逻辑规则。我们的逻辑告诉我们，如果地球比火星更接近太阳，那么地球不可能同时离太阳更远。一个正确表述的真理不能同时是真的和假的。说谎者悖论不是“正确表述的”，因此不能证明任何与一个真理前提相反的东西。“这句话不能被证明是正确的”是自指的，对关于现实的一套真实定理没有贡献。如果我们考虑道尔顿主义或简单的品味问题，“这件毛衣是红色的”可能看起来是真的或假的，然而，毛衣反射的真实光谱是可以测量的。是光谱让事实变得真实，而不是对红色的感知。

If you disagree with the *one truth* principle, you may now stop reading. The rest of reasoning in this article is based on the inescapable premise that we all live in the same reality where things cannot be true and false at the same time. We are able to acquire knowledge through our senses and predicate on the truth using the acquired knowledge.

如果你不同意一个真理原则，你现在可以停止阅读。本文中的睡觉推理是建立在一个无法回避的前提之上的，那就是我们都生活在同一个现实中，在这个现实中，事情不可能同时是真的和假的。我们能够通过我们的感官获得知识，并利用所获得的知识来断言真理。

In terms of hermeneutics or algorithmic information theory, we are looking for reducing the *distance* between the two bodies of knowledge that might exist in the mind of two different people, social groups or philosophical systems. In plain language, we are looking for contradictions and logical basis of contradictory statements. For example, Jews and Muslims are forbidden to eat pork (i.e. *the flesh of the filthiest animal*). Christians, on the other hand, enjoy eating pork (with not so good an impact on their coronary arteries). It is easy to see that rationally carried pork debate will sooner or later be reduced down to the scriptures where the core contradiction must be found. Naturally, the debate will often rage as to which books or their translations make the word of God or even the ultimate word of God. Then a quote from [Septuagint](http://spindleworks.com/septuagint/septuagint.htm) : [Leviticus : Chapter 11](http://www.site-berea.com/C/wb/v03c11.html) may surface and a Christian may question his or her own dietary habits.

从解释学或算法信息论的角度来看，我们正在寻求缩小可能存在于两个不同的人、社会团体或哲学系统头脑中的两个知识体系之间的距离。在通俗易懂的语言中，我们在寻找矛盾和矛盾陈述的逻辑基础。例如，犹太人和穆斯林被禁止吃猪肉(即最脏动物的肉)。另一方面，基督徒喜欢吃猪肉(对冠状动脉的影响不大)。很容易看出，理性的猪肉之争迟早会沦落到必须找到核心矛盾的经文上。当然，关于哪些书或它们的译本构成了上帝的话语，甚至是上帝的终极话语的争论经常会非常激烈。然后引用七十章的一句话：利未记：第11章可能会浮出水面，基督徒可能会质疑他或她自己的饮食习惯。

In other words, resolving hermeneutic debates will never be easy, but formally speaking, it is always possible. It is only the question of the debate discipline and time allocated. Incidentally, here comes the learning imperative: you cannot predicate on the superiority of your own religion or philosophy without understanding the position of the others.

换句话说，解决阐释学的争论从来都不是一件容易的事，但从形式上讲，它总是有可能的。这只是辩论纪律和分配的时间的问题。顺便说一句，学习势在必行：你不能在不了解他人立场的情况下，就以你自己的宗教或哲学的优越性为前提。

Most people agree with the one truth concept; however, they often see one truth from quite a special angle:

*[One Truth](http://www.newadvent.org/summa/101606.htm)* in Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Theologica (13th century)**[Truth is One](http://truthisone.org/)* - *One Supreme Reality* website

大多数人同意一个真理的概念，但他们往往从一个相当特殊的角度来看待一个真理：

托马斯·阿奎那的一个真理，“总结神学”(13世纪)

## What is good?

## 什么是善？

Interpretation of what is good and what is bad depends on an individual. Some people believe GMOs are a threat to biological survival of the planet, others see it as a way of eliminating poverty. Genetic engineering will then be perceived as good or as evil depending on the point of view. However, we can extract some common underlying values. Human life and welfare are the core priority for a vast majority of both opponents and supporters of transgenics. The divide is bridgeable with knowledge via education and communication. However, humans also often differ as far as their core beliefs are concerned. Although well-established core beliefs are rarely subject to negotiation, they are also based on knowledge and experience. Here too, differences and contradictions can be alleviated by knowledge and communication. Even if an individual is impervious to arguments against his or her beliefs, the same beliefs may be molded over generations and incorporate influences from other belief systems.

什么是好的，什么是坏的取决于个人。一些人认为转基因生物是对地球生物生存的威胁，另一些人则认为它是消除贫困的一种方式。然后，基因工程将根据不同的观点被认为是好的还是坏的。然而，我们可以提取一些共同的潜在价值。对于绝大多数转基因的反对者和支持者来说，人类的生命和福利都是核心优先事项。通过教育和交流，知识可以弥合这一鸿沟。然而，就核心信仰而言，人类也经常存在差异。虽然既定的核心信念很少受到谈判的影响，但它们也是建立在知识和经验的基础上的。在这里，分歧和矛盾也可以通过知识和交流来缓解。即使一个人不受反对他或她的信仰的争论的影响，同样的信仰可能会经过几代人的塑造，并纳入其他信仰体系的影响。

It is helpful here to differentiate between **instrumental good** and **intrinsic good**. Instrumental good is a good that serves another good (e.g. learning chemistry is good as far as it helps pass exams to the university). Intrinsic good is a good that is good on its own without serving as a way towards another good. Depending on the belief system intrinsic good may be undefined, elected axiomatically, or elected on the basis of faith. Examples of intrinsic good in various belief systems: God, love, nirvana, human life, pleasure, reaching the paradise, economic growth, etc. (for more about the instrumental-intrinsic value distinction and an easy-to-read introduction to the value theory see: [Value theory](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_theory)).

在这里，区分工具善和内在善是很有帮助的。工具性的好是一种服务于另一种好的好的东西(例如，学习化学就是好的，因为它有助于通过大学的考试)。内在善是一种本身是善的善，而不是通向另一善的途径。根据信仰体系的不同，内在善可能是未定义的，可能是公理推选的，也可能是基于信仰推选的。不同信仰体系中内在善的例子：上帝、爱、涅槃、人的生活、快乐、到达天堂、经济增长等(更多关于工具与内在价值的区别和价值理论的简单介绍见：价值理论)。

It does not take long to realize that there is no scientific method or instrument that can measure or certify intrinsic value. Recent stem cell research plans of Dr Ian Wilmut (father of Dolly the sheep) have been attacked on ethical grounds. However, where there is no consensus on intrinsic value, there is no definition of what is really ethical and what is not. Wilmut's opponents have to resort to emotions saying: *"these are Dr Mengele experiments"*, *"this is Frankenstein science"*, *"Wilmut resorts to cannibalism"* or simply *"this is wrong"*. Dr Wilmut can strike back with emotional depiction of someone suffering from a heart or Parkinson's disease. He can then add that banning his work *"is wrong"*. Only democratic, legislative and/or judicial mechanism can resolve the deadlock on "preponderance of ethical intuition". It is not possible to resolve the difference of opinion in a methodical manner.

用不了多久就会意识到，没有科学的方法或仪器可以衡量或证明内在价值。伊恩·威尔穆特博士(绵羊多利的父亲)最近的干细胞研究计划受到了伦理上的攻击。然而，在内在价值上没有共识的地方，就没有什么是真正道德的定义，什么不是道德的定义。威尔穆特的反对者不得不诉诸情绪，说：“这是门格勒博士的实验”，“这是科学怪人的科学”，“威尔穆特诉诸于吃人”，或者干脆说“这是错误的”。威尔穆特博士可以用对患有心脏病或帕金森氏症的人的情感描述进行反击。然后他可以补充说，禁止他的工作“是错误的”。只有民主、立法和/或司法机制才能解决“伦理直觉占优势”的僵局。以有条不紊的方式解决意见分歧是不可能的。

The purpose of life and the question of value occupied philosophers for centuries without much progress in finding scientifically valid and non-circular definition of intrinsic good. The distinction between intrinsic and instrumental good certifiably dates back to Aristotle (see: [Nicomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics)). It forms the basis of David Hume's insistence that we can study *"what is"*, but not *"what should be"*. It is analogous to Kantian hypothetical and categorical imperative. This distinction is as old as human self-awareness. After all, we all must ask a question about the ultimate purpose of our existence.

生命的目的和价值的问题占据了哲学家们几个世纪，但在寻找科学上有效的、非循环的内在善的定义方面没有取得太大进展。内在善和工具性善之间的区别可以肯定地追溯到亚里士多德(参见：尼科马基伦理学)。它构成了大卫·休谟坚持认为我们可以研究“是什么”而不是“应该是什么”的基础。它类似于康德的假设和绝对命令。这种区别和人类的自我意识一样古老。毕竟，我们都必须问一个关于我们存在的最终目的的问题。

## Systems of value

## 价值体系

As soon as humans became capable of self-analysis, they must have pondered the ultimate purpose of their daily pursuits. Over millennia, three major systems of value developed. Each provides its own answer to the question of what makes the intrinsic value. I would like to go through these systems of value and see if knowledge promotes goodness within each system. Later we will also try to see if knowledge helps unify the concept of goodness between each of these systems.

一旦人类有了自我分析的能力，他们一定已经思考了他们日常追求的最终目的。几千年来，形成了三大价值体系。对于什么构成内在价值这一问题，每个人都提供了自己的答案。我想仔细看看这些价值体系，看看知识是否促进了每个体系中的善。稍后，我们还将尝试看看知识是否有助于统一这些系统之间的善的概念。

The three major systems of value:

- **hedonism** - life should aim at maximizing happiness and minimizing pain. Hedonism is the original system of value imprinted in our brains by the evolution
- **religion** - the intrinsic values revolve around the divinity and God. Religion is a way of escaping the evolutionary constraint on the system of value (as in hedonism) by using reason and faith
- **scientific axiology** - intrinsic values should be determined via reason and philosophical methodology. Scientific axiology attempts to figure out the purpose of life solely via the scientific method

三大价值体系：

- 享乐主义——生活的目标应该是最大限度地增加快乐，最大限度地减少痛苦。享乐主义是进化印刻在我们大脑中的原始价值体系。
- 宗教——内在价值围绕着神性和上帝。宗教是一种利用理性和信仰来逃避价值体系(如享乐主义)的进化约束的方式。
- 科学价值论——内在价值应该通过理性和哲学方法论来确定。科学价值论试图完全通过科学方法来找出生命的目的。

It is easy to show formally that these three classes cover all systems of value. We can either accept drives begotten by the evolution or reject them as an invalid guidance of conduct. This distinction is as old as the contraposition of Epicurus' ethic of pleasure and the Stoic's ethic of duty. Once we elect to use the reasoning capacity of the brain to look for goals, we can either accept faith, intuition, and revelation, or exclude them as scientifically invalid. In other words, we can only follow our natural instincts (hedonism), use faith and reason (religion) or resort solely to the scientific method (scientific axiology). There are no other options. Note that the terms used above need to be stretched to provide this all-encompassing quality. *Hedonism* may need to, paradoxically, include a sadomasochist who inflicts pain on himself or an altruist who greatly enjoys making others happy. *Religion* may need to extend beyond the usual understanding of the word and embrace spiritual philosophies, intuitionism (goodness defined through "moral intuition"), and the like. Even though Louis Cassels claims that everyone is religious and has some hypothesis of God, his concept of religion would roughly correspond to the presented term of the *system of value*. This choice of words would avoid labeling confirmed atheists as being religious. *Scientific axiology* is my favored term for a conglomerate of a number of non-metaphysical ethical theories that pepper centuries of philosophy books, where the same concept often crops up under different names in different epochs over and over again.

形式上很容易表明，这三个类别涵盖了所有的价值体系。我们可以接受进化产生的驱动力，也可以拒绝它们，认为它们是一种无效的行为指导。这种区别与伊壁鸠鲁的享乐伦理和斯多葛学派的责任伦理的对立一样古老。一旦我们选择使用大脑的推理能力来寻找目标，我们可以接受信仰、直觉和启示，也可以将它们排除在外，认为它们在科学上是无效的。换句话说，我们只能遵循我们的自然本能(享乐主义)，使用信仰和理性(宗教)，或者仅仅求助于科学方法(科学价值论)。没有其他选择。请注意，上面使用的术语需要扩展以提供这种包罗万象的质量。自相矛盾的是，享乐主义可能需要包括一个给自己带来痛苦的施虐受虐狂，或者一个非常喜欢让他人快乐的利他主义者。宗教可能需要超越对这个词的通常理解，拥抱精神哲学、直觉主义(通过“道德直觉”定义的善)等等。尽管路易斯·卡塞尔声称每个人都是宗教的，对上帝都有一些假设，但他的宗教概念大致与价值体系的现有术语相对应。这样的措辞可以避免给被确认的无神论者贴上宗教标签。科学价值论是我最喜欢的术语，指的是一些非形而上学的伦理理论的集合体，这些理论充斥着几个世纪的哲学书籍，在不同的时代，相同的概念经常以不同的名字反复出现。

Although the conceptual division between the three value systems is rather crisp, we all make up a conglomerate of ethical beliefs that make it hard to pigeonhole anyone into a single category.

尽管这三种价值体系之间的概念划分相当清晰，但我们都是由一系列道德信念组成的，很难将任何人划归为单一类别。

### Hedonism

### 享乐主义

Hedonism is based on the oldest and the most natural *system of value*. It is as old as the nervous system in most primitive multicellular organisms which date back several hundred million years ago. A dog does not ponder the meaning of life, it enjoys it; from low level fun of eating and copulation to chasing a ball or being stroked by "the master". Humans, as all animals, tend to behave along the program imprinted in their brain. This program is based on reward and punishment. Behaviors that served the survival of the species were usually reinforced through the reward system. Today, representatives of all systems of value are subject to the same reward and punishment mechanism in their brain. We (healthy) all are able to experience satisfaction of a good meal or good sleep. We all fear painful injury. Even the truest God-fearing believer will experience temptations of the flesh. Even the most methodical philosopher will scale down her mental soaring when deprived of food and water for long enough. In other words, hedonistic system of value will introduce a degree of interference even among those who scoff the pursuit of pleasure. Our brain reward centers make this world go around. When they fail, we may resort to suicide. Whatever the power of the ethical mind, when in doubt or in a moment of weakness, hedonistic impulse makes individuals go on with their lives. Mother Teresa included.

享乐主义是基于最古老、最自然的价值体系。它和最原始的多细胞生物体的神经系统一样古老，可以追溯到几亿年前。狗不思考生活的意义，它享受生活；从吃和交配的低级乐趣，到追球或被“主人”抚摸。人类，就像所有的动物一样，倾向于按照印在他们大脑中的程序行事。这个项目是以奖惩为基础的。服务于物种生存的行为通常通过奖励系统得到加强。今天，所有价值体系的代表在他们的大脑中都受到同样的奖惩机制。我们(健康的)都能体验到一顿美餐或美美的睡眠带来的满足感。我们都害怕痛苦的伤害。即使是最虔诚的敬畏上帝的信徒也会经历肉体的诱惑。即使是最有条理的哲学家，在长时间没有食物和水的情况下，她的精神飞涨也会降低。换句话说，享乐主义的价值体系将引入一定程度的干预，即使是在那些嘲笑追打快乐的人中间也是如此。我们的大脑奖励中心让这个世界运转。当他们失败时，我们可能会求助于自杀。无论伦理头脑的力量有多大，无论是在怀疑中还是在软弱的时刻，享乐主义的冲动都会促使个人继续生活。包括特蕾莎修女。

### Religion

### 宗教

Religion was the next stage of the development of value systems. Religious beliefs are as old as the human civilization. We might even claim that the birth of humanity dates to the establishment of the first religious explanation of human existence and purpose. Religion provided guidance and comfort to millions for millennia. Some 90-96% of people walking the planet today admit to being religious, worshiping or acknowledging one or more gods. In reality, we should rather admit that the vast majority of human population today represents sort of religious hedonism. Religiously hedonistic people claim to be religious but frequently deviate from their elected system of values to satisfy their needs, dreams and desires.

宗教是价值体系发展的下一个阶段。宗教信仰与人类文明一样古老。我们甚至可以说，人类的诞生可以追溯到对人类存在和目的的第一个宗教解释的确立。几千年来，宗教为数百万人提供了指导和安慰。今天在地球上行走的人中约有90%-96%承认自己信教，崇拜或承认一个或多个神。事实上，我们应该承认，今天的绝大多数人口代表着某种宗教享乐主义。信奉宗教享乐主义的人声称自己有宗教信仰，但为了满足自己的需求、梦想和欲望，他们经常背离自己选择的价值体系。

### Scientific axiology

### 科学价值论

[Scientific axiology](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Scientific_axiology) is the youngest approach to determining value. The term *scientific axiology* or *formal axiology* is best defined as used by [Robert S. Hartman](https://www.hartmaninstitute.org/hierarchy/). In this article, the term *scientific axiology* is used in the widest sense as the scientific attempt to predicate on value. As such, scientific axiology cannot be older that the scientific method itself. [Nyaya school](http://www.iskcon.org/main/twohk/philo/roots/systems/nyaya.htm), [Aristotle](http://www.knuten.liu.se/~bjoch509/works/aristotle/politics.txt), Aquinas, Descartes, Galileo, Leibniz, Pascal, Kant, and countless others made the best use of their reason and knowledge to look for intrinsic value. Aquinas's attempt to reconcile religion with Aristotelian logic might be seen as a vigorous pursuit of scientific axiology limited by the scientific methodology available at his time. Descartes's amazement with the mind and his deductive proof of the existence of a benevolent God also fall into this category (even though his reasoning might proceed along quite different lines had he been informed about the role of the brain and the amazing detail of neuronal structure and function that we uncovered some three centuries later). Scientific axiology overlaps with the concept of consequentialism in which one should do action A if A maximizes good. An effort to prove the existence of God with the help of science also overlaps with this category. Although scoffed at by atheists (see: ["Unbeautiful mind"](http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20020805&s=blackburn080502)), Dr Polkinhorne's reasoning is a recent example: [Religion in the Age of Science](http://www.starcourse.org/jcp/religion.html)

科学价值论是确定价值的最年轻的方法。术语科学价值论或形式价值论的最佳定义是罗伯特·S·哈特曼(Robert S.Hartman)所使用的。在这篇文章中，术语科学价值论被用在最广泛的意义上，作为对价值进行预测的科学尝试。因此，科学价值论不可能比科学方法本身更古老。尼亚亚学派、亚里士多德学派、阿奎那学派、笛卡尔学派、伽利略学派、莱布尼茨学派、帕斯卡学派、康德学派和无数其他学派都充分利用他们的理性和知识来寻找内在价值。阿奎那试图调和宗教与亚里士多德逻辑的尝试可能被视为一种充满活力的科学价值论追打，受到他那个时代现有科学方法论的限制。笛卡尔对头脑的惊讶和他对仁慈上帝存在的演绎证明也属于这一类(尽管如果他被告知大脑的作用以及大约三个世纪后我们发现的令人惊叹的神经元结构和功能的细节，他的推理可能会沿着完全不同的路线进行)。科学价值论与后果主义的概念有重叠之处，在后果主义中，如果A最大化了善，就应该做A行动。在科学的帮助下证明上帝存在的努力也与这一范畴重叠。尽管受到无神论者的嘲笑(参见：“不美丽的心灵”)，波尔金霍恩博士的推理是最近的一个例子：科学时代的宗教

## Prevalence of systems of value

## 价值体系的普及性

In today's world, a vast majority of individuals, independent of what they claim or even believe, follow the essentially hedonistic system of value. This system of value incorporates elements of religion (e.g. in tempering desires of the flesh) and pure game theoretical reasoning (e.g. where being nice pays better than being nasty).

在当今世界，绝大多数人，无论他们声称或甚至相信什么，都遵循本质上享乐主义的价值体系。这种价值体系融合了宗教元素(例如，在缓和肉体欲望方面)和纯粹的博弈论推理(例如，在哪里做好人比做坏人付出更多)。

A truly religious system of value is reserved to a small proportion of the religious elite. Far smaller than what statistics on the prevalence of religious beliefs show. The reason is very simple, religious system of value requires extensive knowledge and dedication that are able to override the powerful drives imprinted in the brain. If we could construct *Religious IQ* for the population to reflect the individual's predisposition and ability to faithfully follow a system of value based on religion, we might discover that people with rIQ below 120-130 are actually better pigeonholed as hedonists, and to reach the heights of John Paul II one would need an rIQ of well above 200-220.

一个真正的宗教价值体系是保留给一小部分宗教精英的。比宗教信仰盛行的统计数字要小得多。原因很简单，宗教价值体系需要广泛的知识和奉献，能够超越大脑中留下的强大动力。如果我们能构建宗教智商人口来反映个人的素质和能力忠实地遵循系统基于宗教的价值,我们可能会发现人们rIQ低于120 - 130年实际上是更好的归类是享乐主义者,和约翰·保罗二世,才能达到人会需要一个rIQ远高于200 - 220。

Scientific axiology is probably the least popular overall. People who reject God and claim to use pure reason to guide their actions are in vast majority strongly influenced by the hedonistic system of value. The group of hedonists who claim pure reason motivations still includes many brilliant individuals who laid the foundation for today's civilization. This comes from the fact that hedonistic reasoning can be driven to quite sophisticated levels where the highest gratification comes from the top level of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs: self-actualization](http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/maslow.html). As science does not provide tools for measuring intrinsic value, many people believe that it is impossible to strictly follow scientific axiology without falling into contradiction or losing our "humanity". This is why scientific axiology is so little known or understood.

科学价值论可能是整体上最不受欢迎的。那些拒绝上帝并声称用纯粹的理性来指导他们的行为的人，绝大多数都受到享乐主义价值体系的强烈影响。声称纯粹理性动机的享乐主义者群体中仍然包括许多为今天的文明奠定基础的才华横溢的人。这来自于这样一个事实，即享乐主义推理可以被驱动到相当复杂的水平，其中最高的满足感来自马斯洛需求层次的顶层：自我实现。由于科学不提供衡量内在价值的工具，许多人认为，严格遵循科学价值论而不陷入矛盾或丧失我们的“人性”是不可能的。这就是为什么科学价值论如此鲜为人知或鲜为人知的原因。

One of my favorite questions in getting to know people is *"What is your ultimate goal? What is the purpose of human life?"*. From my non-scientific survey, I come to believe that the distribution of the systems of value is roughly as follows: pure hedonists (30-60%), religious hedonists (40%-70%), truly religious people (1-5%), and followers of scientific axiology (less than 1%). I need to insist again that we are all a conglomeration of belief and value systems and cannot be easily pigeonholed into a single category.

在认识人的过程中，我最喜欢问的一个问题是“你的终极目标是什么？人生的目的是什么？”从我的非科学调查中，我开始相信价值体系的分布大致如下：纯粹的享乐主义者(30%-60%)，宗教享乐主义者(40%-70%)，真正的宗教人士(1%-5%)，以及科学价值论的追随者(不到1%)。我需要再次强调，我们都是信仰和价值体系的集合体，不能轻易地归入单一类别。

Let us now see how knowledge affects goodness in each of the categories of value systems.

现在让我们看看知识是如何影响每一类价值体系中的善的。

## Hedonism and knowledge

## 享乐主义和知识

Knowledge is able to make us less happy. A sated dog taking a nap may be happier than a sated human aware of the brevity of life. Some hedonist argue that a return to nature would make humans most happy (see: [Primitivism](http://www.primitivism.com/index.html) for a comprehensive example). Return to nature would expose humans to deadly diseases and vagaries of nature, but we might remains blissfully unaware of the dangers, relish the beauty of the natural world, and experience more joy until death or disease struck. However, humans will also naturally tend to look for remedies against disease, for better tools, for better hunting methods, etc. Global trends work against the primitivists or neo-luddites. Someone noticed *"You can't have a violin without civilization"*. It seems that the mankind leaves a hedonist little choice but to make the best use of knowledge to maximize pleasure and minimize pain, while adapting to the inevitable goldrush of progress. Today, illiteracy and poverty are strongly correlated with unhappiness. Unless the present trends of development are reverted, knowledge will play an increasingly important role in making us happy. Very few hedonists will intentionally want to dumb themselves down for the sake of a blind bliss. Many will pursue happiness without a major effort to improve their intellectual strengths. However, a sophisticated hedonist will seek a sophisticated and lasting state of happiness: *eudaimonia*. The happiest hedonist today is the one that is able to transcend lower level needs and find happiness in self-actualization, and contributing to the happiness of others. Statistically, knowledge should help a hedonist achieve happiness.

知识会让我们不那么快乐。一只吃饱了的狗打个盹，可能比一个意识到生命短暂的吃饱了的人更快乐。一些享乐主义者争辩说，回归自然会让人类最幸福(参见：原始主义的全面例子)。回归自然将使人类暴露在致命的疾病和变幻莫测的自然中，但我们可能仍然幸福地没有意识到危险，享受自然世界的美丽，体验更多的快乐，直到死亡或疾病来袭。然而，人类也会自然而然地倾向于寻找治疗疾病的药物，寻找更好的工具，寻找更好的狩猎方法，等等。全球趋势对原始人或新卢德人不利。有人注意到“没有文明就没有小提琴”。人类似乎别无选择，只能最大限度地利用知识，最大限度地增加快乐，最大限度地减少痛苦，同时适应不可避免的进步。今天，文盲和贫困与不幸福密切相关。除非扭转目前的发展趋势，否则知识将在使我们幸福方面发挥越来越重要的作用。极少有享乐主义者会为了盲目的幸福而故意让自己变得愚蠢。许多人会追求幸福，而不会花大力气提高自己的智力优势。然而，一个老练的享乐主义者会寻求一种复杂而持久的幸福状态：幸福。今天最幸福的享乐主义者是那些能够超越底层需求，在自我实现中找到幸福，并为他人的幸福做出贡献的人。从统计学上讲，知识应该能帮助享乐主义者获得幸福。

## Religion and knowledge

## 宗教和知识

Mythology, religion, and science come all from the same source: humans looking for answers. There isn't much methodological difference between the religious distinction of *jiva* and *ajiva* in Jainism, or Hippocratic humors: *bile*, *phlegm*, and *sanguine*. When Aristotle groped in darkness trying to define the *soul*, he was actually writing about *life*. He was not equipped with today's knowledge nor methodology. His explanations might seem metaphysical from today's perspective, but he was as methodical and precise in his thought as his contemporary means.

神话、宗教和科学都来自同一个来源：人类在寻找答案。耆那教中的jiva和ajiva的宗教区别，或希波克拉底的幽默：胆汁、痰和多血，在方法论上没有太大区别。当亚里士多德在黑暗中摸索，试图给灵魂下定义时，他实际上是在写关于生活的东西。他既没有今天的知识，也没有今天的方法论。从今天的角度看，他的解释似乎是形而上学的，但他的思想和他同时代的方法一样有条不紊和精确。

At times religion stood at odds with science and knowledge. Many deeply religious people refute selected facts of science. For example, knowledge of evolution is considered by many as "just a theory". Many see evolution stand in direct conflict with the scriptures. They believe that teaching evolution drives people away from God. To a degree this is true: awareness of evolution is able to undermine religious feelings in some cases. However, the same people will still consider learning and knowledge as paths towards higher wisdom. In other words, they do not consider knowledge as bad. All they consider bad is knowledge which is "false". Not surprisingly, followers of one religion will often consider other religions as "false religions". Yet they will rarely deny the value and importance of learning. All major religions imply a **learning imperative**. This imperative is also an important factor of religion's survival through self-perpetuation. It may largely begin with studying the scriptures. However, knowledge and wisdom are a common denominator of all major religions. Religions survive by answering pressures, reconciling contradictions, and improving their "goodness". Pope John Paul II's call for the reversal of the condemnation of Galileo (a devout Catholic himself) is just one of many recent examples. As it is the case with the hedonistic point of view, many religious people make a minimum effort to enhance their religious knowledge, and their general knowledge. However, a true believer will always look for ways to better understand God, humanity, and the surrounding universe. From the religious perspective, the search for the truth is among the highest objectives.

宗教有时与科学和知识格格不入。许多虔诚的宗教人士驳斥选定的科学事实。例如，进化论的知识被许多人认为“仅仅是一种理论”。许多人认为进化论与经文直接冲突。他们相信教授进化论会让人远离上帝。在某种程度上，这是正确的：在某些情况下，对进化的认识能够破坏宗教感情。然而，同样的人仍然会认为学习和知识是通向更高智慧的途径。换句话说，他们并不认为知识是不好的。他们认为不好的就是“虚假”的知识。不足为奇的是，一种宗教的追随者往往会认为其他宗教是“假宗教”。然而，他们很少会否认学习的价值和重要性。所有主要宗教都隐含着学习的必然性。这种势在必行也是宗教通过自我延续而生存的一个重要因素。这在很大程度上可以从研读经文开始。然而，知识和智慧是所有主要宗教的共同点。宗教通过应对压力、调和矛盾、提高“善”来生存。教皇约翰·保罗二世呼吁撤销对伽利略(他自己也是一名虔诚的天主教徒)的谴责，这只是最近许多例子中的一个。就像享乐主义的观点一样，许多信教的人只做了最少的努力来提高他们的宗教知识和常识。然而，一个真正的信徒总是会想办法更好地理解上帝、人类和周围的宇宙。从宗教的角度来看，寻求真理是最高目标之一。

## Scientific axiology and knowledge

## 科学价值论与知识

By definition, [scientific axiology](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Scientific_axiology) determines value through knowledge. As such, it is inherently knowledge-friendly. Scientific axiology can be traced under different names to innumerous philosophers and thinkers. For that reason, some reshuffle of terminology may be unavoidable. Some predecessors of scientific axiology can be found in ancient philosophies rooted in anti-clerical sentiment (e.g. nastika school of [Carvaka](http://www.humanistictexts.org/carvaka.htm) from ancient India, around 6 century BC, was a reaction against brahmins advancing their own livelihood). However, these all predominantly gravitated towards using reason to justify hedonism (e.g. in Carvaka: *"if there are no unseen forces and world is without a cause, we can only live by the inherent nature of things"*). The effort to explain value with reason intensified from century to century, and culminated in the 20th century with the crystallization of the formal approach to axiology.

根据定义，科学价值论通过知识决定价值。因此，它天生就是知识友好型的。科学价值论可以用不同的名字追溯到无数的哲学家和思想家。出于这个原因，术语的一些重新洗牌可能是不可避免的。科学价值论的一些前辈可以在植根于反神职人员情绪的古代哲学中找到(例如，古印度的卡瓦卡(Carvaka)纳斯提卡学派，大约在公元前6世纪，是对婆罗门推进自己生计的一种反应)。然而，所有这些都主要倾向于用理性来为享乐主义辩护(例如，在卡瓦卡：“如果没有看不见的力量，世界是没有原因的，我们只能依靠事物的内在本质来生活”)。用理性解释价值的努力从一个世纪到另一个世纪不断加强，并在20世纪随着价值论形式方法的结晶而达到顶峰。

### Three ways of the scientific determination of value

### 科学确定价值的三条途径

When science is applied to determining intrinsic value, the following statements are possible as the outcome: (1) "Intrinsic value cannot be determined", (2) "Value can be derived only from value axioms", or (3) "We do not know if we will ever be able to determine intrinsic value". Here are the corresponding branches of scientific axiology:

- **existential** - intrinsic value cannot be determined; as a result, nothing has a true value
- **dogmatic** - intrinsic value is assumed axiomatically for the purpose of building a system of value (in the same way as parallel-postulate axiom can be used to build Euclidean geometry). Innumerous axioms have been proposed. For example: pleasure, human life, life in general, progress, knowledge, evolution, existence, consciousness, beauty, moral intuition, cooperation, etc. Pluralistic approaches allow of more than one axiomatically assumed intrinsic value
- **agnostic** (non-cognitivistic, skeptic) - intrinsic value cannot be determined with presently available tools or methods; however, due to human ignorance, the truth about value might perhaps be disclosed at later time (for details see: [Intrinsically Valuable State](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intrinsically_Valuable_State))

当科学被应用于确定内在价值时，可能的结果是：(1)“内在价值不能确定”，(2)“价值只能从价值公理中导出”，或(3)“我们不知道我们是否能够确定内在价值”。以下是科学价值论的相应分支：

- 无法确定存在的内在价值；因此，没有任何东西具有真正的价值
- 教条内在价值是公理假设的，目的是为了建立一个价值体系(就像平行公理可以用来建立欧几里得几何一样)。不计其数的公理已经被提出。例如：快乐、人类生活、一般生活、进步、知识、进化、存在、意识、美、道德直觉、合作等等。多元的方法允许一种以上的公理假设的内在价值。
- 不可知论(非认知论、怀疑论)--内在价值不能用目前可用的工具或方法来确定；然而，由于人类的无知，关于价值的真相可能会在以后被披露(详情见：内在价值国家)

### Source of valuation

### 价值的来源

At another angle, dogmatic and agnostic [scientific axiology](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Scientific_axiology) will distinguish between these two forms of intrinsic value:

- **relative** - intrinsic values may depend on the valuer (e.g. human being, conscious being, decider automaton, etc.). For example, value subjectivism claims that good is what you desire. Clearly, what is good for me, may be bad for you. If reaching a paradise was to be proven an intrinsic value, it would be a relative intrinsic value as all human beings or their souls are supposed to reach the paradise independent of others
- **absolute** - intrinsic values are absolute. They do not depend on the valuer. For example, if God is proven to be intrinsic value, his value is not supposed to depend on anyone's judgment (see: [Intrinsically Valuable State](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intrinsically_Valuable_State))

从另一个角度来看，教条主义和不可知论的科学价值论将区分这两种形式的内在价值：

- 相对内在价值可能取决于估值者(例如，人、有意识的人、决定者自动机等)。例如，价值主观主义声称善是你想要的。显然，对我有利的，可能对你不利。如果要证明到达天堂是一种内在价值，那么它将是一种相对的内在价值，因为所有的人或他们的灵魂都应该独立于他人而到达天堂。
- 绝对值-内在值是绝对值。它们不依赖于估价师。例如，如果上帝被证明是内在价值，他的价值不应该取决于任何人的判断(参见：内在价值国家)

Dogmatic system of value may arbitrarily choose relative or absolute intrinsic value (e.g. [Ayn Rand's objectivism elects axiomatic relative intrinsic value](http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/rand5.htm): own life). Axiological agnostics will claim that nothing is known about intrinsic values. As such, intrinsic value cannot be determined as to be absolute or relative.

教条主义的价值体系可以任意选择相对或绝对的内在价值(例如，安·兰德的客观主义选择公理化的相对内在价值：自己的生命)。价值论不可知论者会声称对内在价值一无所知。因此，内在价值不能被确定为绝对的或相对的。

### Impact of knowledge on valuations

### 知识对估值的影响

The effects of knowledge on various branches of formal axiology will be different:

知识对形式价值论的各个分支的影响将是不同的：

> **Existential** thinking may be the most impervious to knowledge. If nothing has value, knowledge does not make value either. At the same time, existential thinking might be most flexible and tolerant. If nothing has value, it does not matter whose system value comes top. Nothing matters. Existential thinking is logically equivalent to [ethical non-naturalism](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_non-naturalism). G. E. Moore (1873-1958; no relationship to the father of Moore's Law) in *Principia Ethica* claims that the good cannot be defined due to the *open question* problem (i.e. the problem of infinite derivation of instrumental values in the absence of intrinsic value).
>
> 
>
> 存在主义思维可能是最不受知识影响的。如果没有东西有价值，知识也不会有价值。同时，存在主义思维可能是最灵活、最宽容的。如果任何东西都没有价值，那么谁的系统值排在首位都无关紧要。什么都不重要。存在主义思维在逻辑上等同于伦理非自然主义。G·E·摩尔(1873-1958；与摩尔定律之父无关)在“伦理学原理”一书中声称，由于悬而未决的问题(即在缺乏内在价值的情况下无限推导工具价值的问题)，善不能被定义。

> **Dogmatic** approach to electing intrinsic value will be affected by knowledge. After all, dogmatic values will always be questioned as to why they have been elected axiomatically, and not others. Formally, assuming axiomatically that pleasure is of intrinsic value would reduce dogmatic axiology to hedonistic approach, while assuming that God makes the absolute value will equate axiology with a religion.
>
> 
>
> 选择内在价值的教条主义方法会受到知识的影响。毕竟，教条主义的价值观总是会受到质疑，为什么他们是公理当选的，而不是其他的。形式上，从公理上假设快乐具有内在价值将使教条价值论沦为享乐主义，而假设上帝创造绝对价值，则价值论将等同于宗教。

> **Agnostic** approach seems most knowledge-friendly. Probabilistically, the search for new knowledge is valuable. This comes from the fact that it cannot be stated with certainty that intrinsic value does not exist. Formally, the value can be defined with the help of the concept of *infinitely knowledgeable machine*. Such an automaton should consistently show the preference for selected choices if these choices were to be determined as more valuable than others. From decision theory, we know that the value of choice equals the value of the goal multiplied by the probability of achieving the goal. Consequently, the choice of searching for value is always tagged with value greater than zero. The probability of achieving the goal will never be zero (as nothing in science is certain). Achieving value, by definition is valuable (as negative values can easily be normalized). In agnostic axiology, value is determined by the search for value and the seemingly perpetual inability to certify that value does not exist. In simple terms, if we do not know what makes value, the only thing we can do is to do our best to find out.
>
> 
>
> 不可知论的方法似乎对知识最友好。从概率上讲，寻找新知识是有价值的。这源于这样一个事实，即不能肯定地说内在价值不存在。在形式上，可以借助无限知识机的概念来定义价值。如果要确定所选的选择比其他选择更有价值，那么这样的自动机应该一致地显示出对这些选择的偏好。从决策理论中，我们知道选择的价值等于目标价值乘以实现目标的概率。因此，搜索值的选择始终标记为大于零的值。实现目标的概率永远不会为零(因为科学上没有什么是确定的)。根据定义，实现价值是有价值的(因为负值很容易标准化)。在不可知论的价值论中，价值是由对价值的追求和似乎永远无法证明价值不存在而决定的。简单地说，如果我们不知道什么是价值，我们唯一能做的就是尽力找出答案。

In [scientific axiology](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Scientific_axiology), knowledge is a direct path towards understanding goodness and acting good (even though we may not be able to determine intrinsic value today). In the light of [scientific axiology](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Scientific_axiology), knowledge is good.

在科学价值论中，知识是理解善和行动善的直接途径(即使我们今天可能无法确定内在价值)。从科学价值论的角度看，知识是好的。

## Clash of values

## 价值冲突

Whatever their target goals, humans prevalently benefit through cooperation and lose out on conflict. This simple truth can be demonstrated mathematically with the tools of [game theory](http://www.gametheory.net/). For anyone in doubt, Robert Wright in his book *["Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny"](http://www.nonzero.org/)* provides an excellent collection of examples that illustrate the math of cooperation, and its impact on the cultural evolution of societies. In game theoretical terms, information exchange is vital for maximizing total sum of wins in nozero-sum games. In simple terms, knowledge and communication help cooperation and maximize profits for all participating parties.

无论他们的目标是什么，人类普遍从合作中获益，在冲突中蒙受损失。这个简单的真理可以用博弈论的工具进行数学证明。对于任何有疑问的人，罗伯特·赖特在他的书“非零：人类命运的逻辑”中提供了一个极好的例子集，说明了合作的数学原理，以及它对社会文化进化的影响。在博弈论中，信息交换对于最大化非零和博弈中的总赢利是至关重要的。简而言之，知识和沟通有助于合作，并使所有参与方的利润最大化。

Accomplishing any goal requires a struggle with the second law of thermodynamics. Even destructive goals require constructive activities. Terrorists who planned WTC destruction had to precede their attack with meticulous planning that required communication, organization, cooperation, etc. The struggle against entropy requires compliance with the rules of game theory. Even mafia people stick to some rules of conduct or noble principles brotherhood and loyalty that ensure the coherence and survivability of mafia structure. Religions die out if they do not provide efficient tools for resolving conflict. For that reason major worldwide religions are preponderantly peaceful and love-promoting. Where they seem brutal, they do it for a higher level order (e.g. chopping off limbs to weed the population of evil element). They evoke military tones only for the sake of defending the religion itself, human life, community, etc. Naturally, history shows that those noble goals and exceptions can be perverted and turned into destructive forces. Destructive philosophies die out as do evil leaders that do not efficiently provide for the good of people (or at least the interests of the majority).

实现任何目标都需要与热力学第二定律作斗争。即使是破坏性的目标也需要建设性的活动。计划摧毁世贸中心的恐怖分子在发动袭击之前必须精心策划，这需要沟通、组织、合作等。与熵的斗争需要遵守博弈论的规则。即使是黑手党人也会坚持一些行为规则或高尚原则，即兄弟情谊和忠诚，以确保黑手党结构的连贯性和生存能力。如果宗教不能提供解决冲突的有效工具，它们就会消亡。因此，世界主要宗教绝大多数都是和平和促进爱的。在他们看起来残忍的地方，他们是为了更高级别的秩序(例如，砍掉四肢来除掉邪恶分子的种群)。它们唤起军事色彩只是为了捍卫宗教本身、人的生命、社区等。自然，历史表明，这些高尚的目标和例外可能会被歪曲并转化为破坏性力量。破坏性的哲学消亡了，不能有效地为人民(或至少是大多数人的利益)提供好处的邪恶领导人也会消亡。

The logic of cooperation will therefore be the preponderant theme in showing that knowledge helps reconcile differing philosophies. Earlier I tried to show that hedonists, religious people and proponents of scientific axiology should overwhelmingly consider gaining knowledge as beneficial for themselves. However, will they also consider knowledge to be beneficial if it was to be gained by other representatives of the same value system? Is it good for a hedonist if his hedonist neighbor builds up knowledge? More interesting, how do we look at knowledge enhancing cognitive powers of those whose values differ? Is it good for a devout Muslim, if his atheistic neighbor grows more knowledgeable? For analytical scrupulousness, for n categories of value systems, we would need to consider n!/(n-2)!=n*(n-1) pair permutations. For that reasons, I will limit the considerations to the three major value systems mentioned above that will leave us with a manageable number of six pairs to consider. Of necessity, we can only use prose and very general statements that will not be sufficient to convince those who take a hard line on irreconcilability of value systems:

因此，合作的逻辑将是表明知识有助于调和不同哲学的优势主题。早些时候，我试图表明，享乐主义者、宗教人士和科学价值论的支持者应该压倒性地认为获取知识对他们自己是有益的。然而，如果知识是由同一价值体系的其他代表获得的，他们是否也会认为知识是有益的呢？一个享乐主义者如果他的享乐主义邻居积累知识，这对他有好处吗？更有趣的是，我们如何看待知识增强那些价值观不同的人的认知能力？对于一个虔诚的穆斯林来说，如果他的无神论邻居变得更有见识，这对他有好处吗？为了分析的严谨性，对于n类值系统，我们需要考虑n！/(n-2)！=n*(n-1)对排列。出于这个原因，我将把考虑限制在上面提到的三个主要价值系统上，这将使我们只剩下六对可管理的数量来考虑。当然，我们只能使用散文和非常笼统的陈述，这不足以说服那些对价值体系不可调和采取强硬立场的人：

> **hedonists vs. hedonists**: At the lowest level, their goals are in conflict with each other as every man caters for himself. If we draw a distinction between pleasure and happiness to avoid the pejorative association with the lowly desires, we will delineate the sophisticated form of hedonism: *eudaimonism*. In more sophisticated hedonism, goals will be easier to reconcile: happiness from serving family, community, nation, humanity, etc. Informed hedonist will use game theory to maximize happiness and goodness available in the system thus maximizing probability of his own happiness (see: [Game theory of marriage vows](http://william-king.www.drexel.edu/top/eco/game/vow/marriage.html)). Knowledge serves reconciliation of hedonistic goals.
>
> 
>
> 享乐主义者与享乐主义者：在最低层，他们的目标是相互冲突的，因为每个人都为自己服务。如果我们在快乐和幸福之间划清界限，以避免与卑微欲望的贬义联系在一起，我们就会描绘出享乐主义的复杂形式：享乐主义。在更复杂的享乐主义中，目标将更容易协调：来自服务家庭、社区、国家、人类等的幸福。知情的享乐主义者将使用博弈论来最大化系统中可获得的幸福和善良，从而最大化他自己幸福的可能性(参见：婚姻誓言的博弈论)。知识服务于享乐主义目标的调和。

> **world religions against each other**: Many believers and scholars claim that there is no contradiction between religion and science. Others attempt to synthesize world religions, sciences and philosophy (see: [Theosophy](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/3987/theosop.html) vs. [theosophy](http://skepdic.com/theosoph.html)). Unfortunately, many true believers adamantly reject syncretism. They insist *"There is no divinity other than God and Muhammad is his prophet"* or *"I believe in Jesus Christ, the only son of God"* or *"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One"*. They claim that these statements cannot be reconciled. However, it does not take long to see that inter-faith communication must look for ways to reconcile these truths. Either Jesus is God or a prophet or a false prophet or a mere mortal or a myth. No Christian doubts which is true. Yet representatives of other faiths will differ on that point. Could truths be relative to the place of birth (which is a major factor determining the denomination)? Religions avoid syncretism to avoid dilution which can threaten their survival in the long run. Would Jews walk this planet if they were syncretic in Babylonian captivity? Religions develop mechanisms that prevent syncretic dilution. This prevention is a key player in religious darwinism. Religious darwinism, a term considered offensive by some people, is a study of the birth, evolution and extinction of religious beliefs (as such it should not to be confused with a religiously promoted darwinism or with the law: *"only the righteous survive"*). Anti-syncretic mechanisms include strongly memetic commandments and creeds, scriptures "written in the stone", compliance with game theory, obligatory evangelism, gospel missionaries, covert proselytizing, church planting, prohibiting inter-faith marriages or sexual relations, the concept of blasphemy, censorship ([Index librorum prohibitorum](http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/ILP-1559.htm)), severe punishment for renunciation, etc. Religious darwinism which looks at religions as memes or ideaviruses demonstrates that due to immutable characteristics of human social and cultural life, there are multiple common denominators across world's major religions. These characteristics are shaped by game theoretical principles of maximizing psychological welfare gain to the followers. The surviving religions with worldwide appeal are predominantly good from each other's perspective; at least as considered by open-minded religious scholars. This does not prevent Crusades, Hindus and Muslims slaughtering each other; Jews and Palestinians in a headlock of hate, or [Franklin Graham declaring Islam a "wicked religion"](http://www.cair-net.org/asp/article.asp?articleid=1&articletype=3) (let alone Rev. Jerry Falwell's [unprintable comments](http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/06/13/cf.crossfire/) that resulted in riots and loss of life). However, the more enlightened and educated a believer, the more tolerance (s)he will show for other faiths. For example, compare Franklin Graham comments to the ecumenical bridge-building philosophy of his father [Billy Graham](http://www.billygraham.org/). Knowledge helps. Scriptures might call for aggressive evangelism and militant opposition to syncretism, but [knowledge helps to ease the differences](http://www.ishwar.com/) and dilute potential conflict.

> 世界宗教对立许多信仰者和学者声称宗教和科学并不矛盾。其他人试图综合世界宗教、科学和哲学(参见：神智学与神智学)。不幸的是，许多真正的信徒坚决反对融合。他们坚持“除了上帝没有其他的神，穆罕默德是他的先知”，或者“我相信耶稣基督，上帝的独生子”，或者“以色列啊，主我们的上帝，请听，主是一位”。他们声称这些说法不可调和。然而，用不了多久就会发现，不同信仰间的交流必须寻找调和这些真理的方法。耶稣要么是上帝，要么是先知，要么是假先知，要么是凡人，要么是神话。没有基督徒的怀疑，这是真的。然而，其他信仰的代表在这一点上会有所不同。真相是否与出生地有关(出生地是决定宗派的主要因素)？宗教避免融合，以避免稀释，因为从长远来看，这可能会威胁到它们的生存。如果犹太人在巴比伦的囚禁中融合，他们会在这个星球上行走吗？宗教发展出防止融合稀释的机制。这种预防是宗教达尔文主义的关键。宗教达尔文主义，这个被一些人认为是冒犯的术语，是一门研究宗教信仰的诞生、进化和灭绝的学科(因此，它不应该与宗教上提倡的达尔文主义相混淆，也不应该与“只有正直的人才能生存”的法律混为一谈)。反融合机制包括强烈的模因戒律和信条、“写在石头上”的经文、遵守博弈论、强制传福音、福音传教士、秘密传教、建立教会、禁止不同信仰间的婚姻或性关系、亵渎神明的概念、审查制度、严惩弃教等等。宗教达尔文主义将宗教视为模因或意识形态病毒，表明由于人类社会一成不变的特点，宗教达尔文主义表明，由于人类社会不可改变的特点，宗教达尔文主义表明，由于人类社会一成不变的特点，亵渎神明的概念、审查制度(Index Librorum Prohibitorum)、对放弃的严厉惩罚等。宗教达尔文主义将宗教视为模因或意识形态病毒，表明由于人类社会不可改变的特征这些特征是由追随者心理福利最大化的博弈论原理形成的。从彼此的角度来看，具有世界吸引力的幸存宗教大多是好的；至少在思想开放的宗教学者看来是这样。这并没有阻止十字军东征、印度教徒和穆斯林互相屠杀；犹太人和巴勒斯坦人在仇恨中纠缠不休，或者富兰克林·格雷厄姆(Franklin Graham)宣布伊斯兰教是“邪恶的宗教”(更不用说牧师杰里·福尔韦尔(Jerry Falwell)导致骚乱和生命损失的不堪入目的评论了)。然而，一个信徒越开明、越有教养，他对其他信仰的容忍度就越高。例如，将富兰克林·格雷厄姆(Franklin Graham)的评论与他父亲比利·格雷厄姆(Billy Graham)的普世架桥哲学进行比较。知识是有帮助的。圣经可能会呼吁积极的福音传播和激进的反对融合，但知识有助于缓解分歧，冲淡潜在的冲突。

> **philosophers against each other**: Followers of scientific axiology under its countless names are probably the most confused and the most confusing group. Willy-nilly, they have to acknowledge humanity's limitless ignorance in the area of purely rational interpretation of the purpose and the value. They are not able to measure, detect or rationally postulate intrinsic value. In those circumstances, they are more likely to join forces with other people to seek enlightenment. This may come for psychological reasons: a lonely philosopher might use community as an anti-dote to depressive awareness that sense and value are so elusive. This may also come for purely rational reasons: together we are more likely to reach the truth. Philosophers will overwhelmingly elect knowledge to be good.

> 哲学家彼此对立：冠以无数名字的科学价值论的追随者可能是最困惑和最令人困惑的群体。不管愿意不愿意，他们都必须承认，在对目的和价值的纯粹理性解释方面，人类是无限无知的。他们不能测量、检测或合理假定内在价值。在这种情况下，他们更有可能与他人联合起来寻求启迪。这可能是心理上的原因:一个孤独的哲学家可能会用群体来对抗抑郁意识，因为感觉和价值是如此难以捉摸。这也可能是出于纯粹的理性原因：我们在一起更有可能找到真相。哲学家会压倒性地认为知识是好的。

> **hedonism vs. religion**: seemingly these two are irreconcilable. Basically, hedonist serves himself and a religious person serves God. However, most hedonists and believers are far from being of a pure breed. Hedonists are often altruistic. Believers often bend the religious dogma to fit their own goals and desires. Knowledge makes hedonists less egoistic. Knowledge makes believers more tolerant. Knowledge helps them stomach one another. It brings them closer. It promotes goodness.

> 享乐主义与宗教：这两者似乎是不可调和的。基本上，享乐主义者是为自己服务的，宗教人士是为上帝服务的。然而，大多数享乐主义者和信徒远不是纯种的。享乐主义者通常是无私的。信徒经常改变宗教教条，以适应他们自己的目标和愿望。知识使享乐主义者不那么自私自利。知识使信徒更宽容。知识帮助他们相互消化。这让他们走得更近了。它促进善良。

> **hedonism vs. science**: all humans are born hedonists and develop a degree of scientific outlook on life via education (even though at times pitifully scant). Knowledge brings a hedonist to a higher level of awareness. Even though scientists often seem to be stronger on expertise than on morals, knowledge helps them understand the threats of doing science without looking for its sociological implications. Knowledge also helps the rest of the world understand science and its goals. Communication helps reconcile differences between hedonists and science.

> 享乐主义与科学：所有人类都是天生的享乐主义者，并通过教育培养出一定程度的科学人生观(尽管有时少得可怜)。知识将享乐主义者带到更高的意识水平。尽管科学家似乎往往更注重专业知识而不是道德知识，但知识帮助他们理解了从事科学研究的威胁，而不去寻找其社会学含义。知识也有助于世界睡觉理解科学及其目标。沟通有助于调和享乐主义者和科学之间的分歧。

> **religion vs. scientific axiology**: religion is a form of scientific axiology from the times where humans knew little of the scientific method. It was the first attempt of predicating on value. Religion has often been accused of stifling science, but its roots are in the learning imperative. The first words the angel Jabril said to prophet Muhammad was "Iqra" (~read). This command contributed to five centuries of Islamic excellence in science. Religious scholars often look for ways of reconciling scriptures with experimental and theoretical research. Beginning with Renaissance, science largely assumed life of its own. With time gone by, it became more and more skeptical of divine claims. However, religion follows science and adopts its teaching to new findings about the universe. What seemed a heresy at first, became a component of religious teaching centuries later. Reconciliation between religion and science is awfully slow. It rarely takes a generation. It often takes centuries. The rift seems to be growing at times of scientific acceleration. Genetic engineering, for example, is univocally condemned by major religions and spiritual philosophies. For a Buddhist or a Jain, it contradicts *Ahimsa* (not harming), and is interpreted by some as impacting transcendence (potential for spiritual wisdom and liberation). For a monotheist, genetic engineering is plain playing God. For no direct religious reason, an African government can see GM-food aid as an obstacle on their country's way to fastidious European agricultural markets (see: [Better dead than GM-fed](http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1337197)). Yet positions tend to soften in cases where particular GM applications greatly benefit humanity. For example, where GMOs act as a blessing against poverty and famine. Many religious scholars claim that the rift between the revelation and the reason is long gone. For those who do not agree, it is easy to note that religion calls for love. If love cannot be proven valuable, scientific axiology calls for game theoretical cooperation. Both call for tolerance rather than conflict. Many scientists are deeply religious. Most believers acknowledge the validity of science. Understanding each other via knowledge and communication helps the common good. Knowledge is good again.

> 宗教与科学价值论：宗教是人类对科学方法知之甚少的时代科学价值论的一种形式。这是基于价值进行预测的第一次尝试。宗教经常被指责扼杀科学，但它的根源在于学习的必要性。天使贾布里尔对先知穆罕默德说的第一句话是“Iqra”(~Read)。这一命令促成了五个世纪以来伊斯兰在科学上的卓越表现。宗教学者经常寻找调和经文与实验和理论研究的方法。从文艺复兴开始，科学在很大程度上承担了自己的生命。随着时间的推移，人们越来越怀疑神的说法。然而，宗教遵循科学，并采用它的教义来解释关于宇宙的新发现。起初看起来像是异端的东西，几个世纪后变成了宗教教学的一个组成部分。宗教和科学之间的和解非常缓慢。这几乎不需要一代人的时间。这通常需要几个世纪的时间。在科学加速的时候，这种裂痕似乎正在扩大。例如，基因工程受到主要宗教和精神哲学的明确谴责。对于佛教徒或斋戒教徒来说，它与阿希姆萨(不伤害)相矛盾，并被一些人解释为影响超越(精神智慧和解放的潜力)。对于一神论者来说，基因工程就是在扮演上帝。没有直接的宗教原因，非洲政府可以将转基因食品援助视为他们国家通往挑剔的欧洲农产品市场的障碍(参见：宁死也不愿转基因)。然而，在特定的转基因应用极大地造福人类的情况下，立场往往会软化。例如，在那里，转基因生物起到了对抗贫困和饥荒的祝福作用。许多宗教学者声称，启示录和原因之间的裂痕早已不复存在。对于那些不同意的人来说，很容易注意到宗教呼唤爱。如果爱情不能被证明是有价值的，那么科学价值论就需要博弈论的合作。两者都呼吁宽容，而不是冲突。许多科学家都是虔诚的信徒。大多数信徒承认科学的有效性。通过知识和交流相互理解有助于共同利益。知识又变好了。

## Biased knowledge

## 有偏见的知识

Knowledge and communication can be biased. Three factors play the most prominent role in hampering human communication and the growth of true knowledge:

知识和交流可能是有偏见的。三个因素在阻碍人类交流和真正知识的增长方面起着最突出的作用：

- **emotion** - anger, envy, hate and other negative emotions will introduce bias in human thinking. Middle East conflict would have long been resolved had it not been marred in hate and religious intransigence on both sides. Imagine Ariel Sharon lovingly sponsoring schools for young Palestinians, and Hamas getting involved in a campaign to enlighten the Israeli on the virtues of Islam. Sounds like not this world? As much as negative emotions lead to blindness, positive emotions can also block our progress towards the truth and reconciliation. Even the greatest scientist can get carried away by the enthusiasm of a discovery. He can be blinded to the shortcomings of his finding. Love can entirely distort our image of loved people. Mothers are hormonally predisposed to see their kids in the best light; not the truest light. They can also easily overestimate the risks to child's safety. Humans are emotional animals and as such are predisposed to distort the truth. No bright mind should spew disregard and try to humiliate those who are less enlightened. That approach can only backfire in the long run (unless it is used to sell books or for self-promotion). Vicious attack on anyone's philosophy will generate adrenaline, anger and result in more backwardness. I wholeheartedly support the evolutionary science but do not think that [scorn or hair-splitting](http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/crebunk2.htm) helps. In my humble view, [Atheist Web](http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/) or the great minds of Bertrand Russel or Isaac Asimov err in one point: they ridicule and inflame all too often. Adrenaline is a bad advisor. It can spark a raging debate. But it does not build bridges, and it does not open minds. All it can do is to escalate emotion and generate more hot-headed amplification (see the next point)
- 情绪-愤怒、嫉妒、仇恨和其他负面情绪会给人类思维带来偏见。如果中东冲突没有被双方的仇恨和宗教顽固所破坏，它早就会得到解决。想象一下，阿里尔·沙龙(Ariel Sharon)慈爱地赞助巴勒斯坦年轻人的学校，而哈马斯(Hamas)参与了一场向以色列人宣传伊斯兰教美德的运动。听起来不像是这个世界？正如负面情绪导致失明一样，正面情绪也可以挡路我们走向真相与和解的进程。即使是最伟大的科学家也会被发现的热情冲昏头脑。他可以对他的发现的缺点视而不见。爱会完全扭曲我们心爱的人的形象。母亲在荷尔蒙方面倾向于以最好的眼光看待自己的孩子，而不是最真实的一面。他们也很容易高估儿童安全的风险。人类是情绪化的动物，因此容易歪曲事实。任何聪明的人都不应该漠视并试图羞辱那些不那么开明的人。从长远来看，这种方法只会适得其反(除非它被用来卖书或自我推销)。对任何人的哲学的恶毒攻击都会激起肾上腺素和愤怒，导致更多的落后。我全心全意支持进化论，但我不认为轻蔑或吹毛求疵会有帮助。在我看来，无神论者韦伯或伯特兰·罗素或艾萨克·阿西莫夫的伟大思想有一点是错误的：他们经常嘲笑和煽动。肾上腺素不是一个好的顾问。它可能会在电光上引发一场激烈的辩论。但它没有搭建桥梁，也没有开放思想。它所能做的就是升级情绪，产生更多的头脑发热的放大(见下一点)。
- **amplification** - we all have areas of enhanced interest. If we take part in a debate, we tend to triple our effort to find evidence that favors our view, and flinch at counter-evidence. We scrupulously memorize the pros while the cons slip the backdoor. Intense interest in a given field produces a positive feedback of amplification. The more you know, the more you know you don't know, and the more your interest develops. This is a typical lock-in that produces selective amplification. If you hear a Muslim and a Hindu debate matters of religion, in most cases one knows very little of the beliefs of the other. They may be fluent in their own scriptures or Vedas, but show total ignorance of the other side's religious philosophy. Ask a Christian if Muslims recognize Krishna as a prophet. You will likely get a blank stare. Ask a Muslim or a Hindu and you will still likely get no answer either. Or the answers will be contradictory. If you hear a Jehovah witness talk religion with a Roman Catholic, they will often throw in an offensive concept of *false religion* even if they recognize same scriptures. In-depth knowledge is often replaced with false stereotypes. Individual interests and bias is not the only source of amplification. We also tend to communicate extensively with members of our own inner communication circle. List servers and user groups on the Internet show how we tend to flock together and passionately amplify each other's knowledge. Moderators frequently filter not-so-nice comments from people with the opposite or unwelcome view. Amplification can easily be remedied with an open mind and readiness to listen and learn
- 放大——我们都有兴趣增强的领域。如果我们参加辩论，我们往往会加倍努力去寻找支持自己观点的证据，而在相反的证据面前退缩。我们一丝不苟地记住了优点，而缺点则从后门溜走。对给定领域的强烈兴趣会产生放大的正反馈。你知道的越多，你知道你不知道的越多，你的兴趣就会发展得越多。这是一种产生选择性放大的典型锁定。如果你听到一个穆斯林和一个印度教徒就宗教问题进行辩论，在大多数情况下，一方对另一方的信仰知之甚少。他们可能流利地阅读自己的经文或吠陀经，但对对方的宗教哲学表现出完全的无知。问问基督徒穆斯林是否承认克里希纳是先知。你可能会得到一个茫然的眼神。问一个穆斯林或印度教徒，你也很可能得不到答案。否则答案就会相互矛盾。如果你听到一个耶和华见证会与一个罗马天主教徒谈论宗教，他们经常会提出一个令人不快的错误宗教的概念，即使他们认识相同的经文。深入的知识往往被错误的刻板印象所取代。个人兴趣和偏见并不是放大的唯一来源。我们也倾向于与自己圈子内的人进行广泛的交流。互联网上的列表服务器和用户组显示出我们倾向于聚集在一起，热情地扩大彼此的知识。版主经常过滤那些持相反观点或不受欢迎观点的人的不太好的评论。虚心听取和学习可以很容易地补救
- **genes** - some emotions have a genetic background. Genes can strongly affect people's political outlook. Some genetic traits may correlate strongly with racist views, conservatism, leftist outlook, vegetarianism, etc. As such, genes can also interfere with our perception of the truth and with the shape of our system of value. For example, it is well known that we are born with certain preferences as to the choice of a sexual partner. Minor differences may gradually get amplified through environmental factors. One European male teenager may show a strong preference for blondes with blue eyes. Another one may show a taste for exotic Asian or African beauty. Through further amplification, the two may differ strongly on the point of immigration. For one, immigration dilutes the prevalence of blondes with blue eyes, and leads to a blonde genotype extinction. For the other, immigration enhances the impoverished European genetic pool with pleasant repercussions in the field of esthetics and beauty. With time, through amplification, the rift between the two individuals may grow unbridgeable. Similarly, humans show a varying sensitivity to witnessing pain inflicted on animals or other individuals. Empathy is a strongly human characteristic and is to a degree determined genetically (with factors such as the structure of the prefrontal cortex, levels of testosterone, prolactin, serotonin, etc.). Empathetic individuals are often more sensitive to pain and show lower stress tolerance. Some of us can easily stomach pain, while others flinch at the look of a frog killed on the roadside. The empathetic individuals are more likely to represent leftist causes, join animal welfare movements, become vegetarians, oppose death penalty, etc. Those less empathetic will often be better suited as CEOs, surgeons, warriors or world leaders (in politics you cannot escape painful choices and scorn). High-testosterone people will often embrace conservative causes based on the survival of the fittest. Driven to an extreme, empathetic individuals might become environmental terrorists while unempathetic ones could become serial killers. As the political scene in nearly all countries shows, the value gap between the extreme left and the extreme right is very hard to bridge. This gap is potentiated by a number of genetic differences between individuals. Although abhorred by many a nationalist or racist, global inter-breeding is nothing but good news for leveling differences of opinion that might have deep genetic roots. Naturally, there are also inherent and unbridgeable difference between the sexes. However, these pose no threat to the quest for the truth as the survival of the species relies on both genders and biology provides a very special bond between the two. We need both strong high-testosterone leaders as well as more moderate minds that make sure that adrenaline-driven emotion does not cloud the mind. Last but not least, except for pathological cases, knowledge is an excellent and efficient remedy for the bias that might be introduced by our genes
- 基因——有些情绪有遗传背景。基因可以强烈地影响人们的政治观点。一些基因特征可能与种族主义观点、保守主义、左派观点、素食主义等密切相关。因此，基因也会干扰我们对真理的认知和我们价值体系的形成。例如，众所周知，我们生来就对性伴侣的选择有一定的偏好。微小的差异可能会通过环境因素逐渐放大。一名欧洲男性青少年可能会对蓝眼睛的金发女郎表现出强烈的偏好。另一种可能表现出对充满异国情调的亚洲或非洲美的品味。通过进一步的放大，这两个人在移民问题上可能会有很大的不同。首先，移民稀释了蓝眼睛金发女郎的流行，并导致了金发基因型的灭绝。另一方面，移民加强了贫穷的欧洲基因库，在美学和美容领域产生了令人愉快的影响。随着时间的推移，通过放大，两个人之间的裂痕可能会变得不可逾越。同样，人类对目睹动物或其他人遭受的痛苦表现出不同的敏感度。移情是人类强烈的特征，在一定程度上是由遗传决定的(与前额叶皮质的结构、睾酮、催乳素、血清素等因素有关)。有同情心的人通常对疼痛更敏感，对压力的耐受力较低。我们中的一些人很容易忍受疼痛，而另一些人则在看到路边被杀的青蛙时畏缩。有同情心的人更有可能代表左翼事业，加入动物福利运动，成为素食者，反对死刑等等。那些没有同情心的人往往更适合担任首席执行官、外科医生、战士或世界领导人(在政治上，你无法逃脱痛苦的选择和鄙视)。高睾丸素的人通常会信奉基于优胜劣汰的保守事业。被推向极端，有同情心的人可能会成为环境恐怖分子，而没有同情心的人可能会成为连环杀手。正如几乎所有国家的政治场景所显示的那样，极左翼和极右翼之间的价值鸿沟很难弥合。个体之间的许多遗传差异加剧了这种差距。尽管许多民族主义者或种族主义者对此深恶痛绝，但全球通婚对于弥合可能有深层次基因根源的观点分歧来说只是个好消息。当然，两性之间也存在着固有的、不可逾越的差异。然而，这些都不会对寻求真相构成威胁，因为物种的生存依赖于性别，而生物学在两者之间提供了一种非常特殊的纽带。我们既需要强大的高睾丸素领导者，也需要更温和的头脑，以确保肾上腺素驱动的情绪不会遮蔽头脑。最后但并非最不重要的一点是，除了病理情况外，对于我们的基因可能带来的偏见，知识是一种极好且有效的补救方法。

Knowledge and communication are the best tools for reconciling philosophical or political differences. Those who seek reconciliation must avoid the biasing impact of emotion and be aware of knowledge amplification.

知识和交流是调和哲学或政治分歧的最佳工具。那些寻求和解的人必须避免情绪的偏颇影响，并意识到知识的放大。

## Can systems of value be reconciled?

## 价值体系可以调和吗？

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) showed little trust for human nature: *"Look at the unleashing of total war, the wholesale debasement and brutalization, the lunatic destructiveness, the piles of bodies -- you who believe men are suited to live rationally and peacefully together with a minimum of restraint, without stern and inflexible control!"*. Yet he felt compelled to provide a prescriptive analysis in [Leviathan](http://www.orst.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html) thus proving Robert Wright's contention that nonzero thinking is a powerful mechanism towards universal reconciliation. Hobbes rationalized moral rules using a secular argument as the means towards achieving *"peaceable, social, and comfortable living"* (hedonistic angle).

托马斯·霍布斯(1588-1679)对人性缺乏信任：“看看全面战争的爆发，大规模的贬损和残暴，疯狂的破坏，成堆的身体--你们这些认为人适合理性地、和平地生活在一起，最小限度地克制，不受严厉和僵硬控制的人！”然而，他觉得有必要在“利维坦”中提供规定性的分析，从而证明了罗伯特·赖特的论点，即非零思维是通向普遍和解的有力机制。霍布斯将道德规则合理化，使用世俗论证作为实现“和平、社会和舒适生活”的手段(享乐主义角度)。

To show that all systems of value can lead to the best of human behavior and attitude, let's consider an example of a teacher standing in front of her class and thinking *"I will do my best to help my students excel"*:

为了说明所有的价值体系都可以带来最好的人类行为和态度，让我们来看一个例子，一位老师站在她的班级面前，想着“我会尽我最大的努力帮助我的学生出类拔萃”：

- hedonist: *"Seeing happy faces of my students is the most gratifying experience"*
- religious person: *"It's my God-given mission to make my students excel"*
- pure-reason person: *"My students must be top-quality intrinsic value contributors"*
- 享乐主义者：“看到我的学生们笑容满面是最令人欣慰的经历。”
- 宗教人士：“让我的学生出类拔萃是我上天赋予的使命。”
- 纯粹理性的人：“我的学生必须是一流的内在价值贡献者”

(whatever the interpretation of what is intrinsically valuable)

(无论对内在价值的解释是什么)

Knowledge is the best tool for reconciling differences between systems of value. Knowledge will affect the reasoning of all teachers representing different systems of value. Education, tradition, and experience will make the hedonistic teacher focus on seeing happy faces rather than waiting for the next pay that would put more or better food on his table. Knowledge will affect a religiously inspired teacher too. Instead of focusing on observance, rituals and dogma, he will look for core moral values and taught knowledge per se. He will be armed with tolerance. He might be a creationist but will not make a young proponent of evolution feel worse or ostracized or even think *"my teacher is dumb"*. He or she will not impose his religious beliefs on those who might belong to another denomination. He might initiate an open discussion instead.

知识是调和价值体系之间差异的最佳工具。知识会影响代表不同价值体系的所有教师的推理。教育、传统和经验将使享乐主义教师专注于看到快乐的面孔，而不是等待下一份能让他的餐桌上有更多或更好食物的工资。知识也会影响受宗教启发的教师。他不会把重点放在遵守、仪式和教条上，而是寻找核心的道德价值观和传授的知识本身。他将用宽容来武装自己。他可能是一个创世论者，但不会让一个年轻的进化论支持者感觉更糟，不会被排斥，甚至不会认为“我的老师是个哑巴”。他或她不会把他的宗教信仰强加给那些可能属于其他教派的人。相反，他可能会发起一场公开讨论。

Without complete reconciliation, representatives of different value systems can cooperate and present outwardly similar attitudes. With gradual learning and communication, they will be able to come closer to the final reconciliation as to their core values. Ultimate reconciliation on all imaginable ethical choices seems near-to impossible for their complex nature (see the next paragraph). However, human development indicates constant progress towards this elusive goal.

如果没有完全的和解，不同价值体系的代表可能会合作，并表现出表面上相似的态度。通过逐步学习和沟通，他们将能够更接近核心价值观的最终和解。由于其复杂性，在所有可以想象的道德选择上的最终和解似乎近乎不可能(见下一段)。然而，人类发展表明，朝着这一难以捉摸的目标不断前进。

## Universal intrinsic value does not guarantee universal reconciliation

## 普遍内在价值不能保证普遍和解

If we ever come to specifying precisely what makes the intrinsic value, we will lay a foundation for a universal ethical system of value. However, this will not end the problem with differences in moral judgments. As an example, let us consider the following rule of conduct: *Do not kill*. All major ethical systems come to the non-killing rule one way or another. For that reason, it can be called a *nearly universal rule of conduct*. However, we all know that the rule is imprecise enough to result in raging ethical debates in many societies. Most humans accept killing animals for food. Many support death penalty or war in Afghanistan. Here are some problems with the non-killing rule:

如果我们有一天能够准确地说明是什么构成了内在价值，我们就会为普遍的价值伦理体系奠定基础。然而，这不会结束道德判断差异的问题。举个例子，让我们考虑一下下面的行为准则：不要杀人。所有主要的道德体系都会以这样或那样的方式达成不杀戮规则。因此，它可以被称为近乎通用的行为规则。然而，我们都知道，这条规则不够精确，以至于在许多社会引发了激烈的伦理辩论。大多数人类接受杀死动物作为食物。许多人支持死刑或阿富汗战争。以下是不杀戮规则的一些问题：

- What forms of life are subject to the rule? Does it extend beyond humans? Does it extend beyond conscious life? How far? Depending on the underlying intrinsic value, the line is drawn at a different place. Hedonist might primary adopt non-killing for the fear of being killed himself. Or for the unpleasant feeling evoked in his mind by the death of a human or an animal. For a Hindu, killing cattle or a monkey is a cardinal sin. Dogmatic axiologist may axiomatically assume the definition of life that is subject to protection. Agnostic axiologist may see conscious life as a way towards determining intrinsic value, and see killing a human far greater a crime than killing a conscious non-human primate
- 哪些生命形式受到这一规则的约束？它是否超出了人类的范畴？它是否超越了有意识的生活？多远？根据潜在的内在价值，这条线会在不同的位置绘制。享乐主义者可能会因为害怕自己被杀而主要采用非杀戮。或者是因为人类或动物的死亡在他的脑海中唤起的不愉快的感觉。对于印度教徒来说，杀牛或杀猴子是大罪。教条主义的价值学家可能会从公理上假定生命受到保护的定义。不可知论者价值学家可能会将有意识生命视为确定内在价值的一种方式，并认为杀害人类比杀害有意识的非人类灵长类动物要严重得多。
- Is self-killing permissible? Hedonist may accept suicide or euthanasia as a way to escape suffering. In extreme cases, global relief from suffering by global suicide becomes acceptable in a hedonist extreme (see *[negative utilitarianism](http://www.hedweb.com/negutil.htm)*). A Muslim may see a suicide bombing as a form of martyrdom in defense of holy places, religious laws, or oppressed population. A dogmatic axiologist may see self-killing as an inalienable right to self-determination. On the other hand, he may also see it as an inexcusable offence. It simply depends on the arbitrary choice of intrinsic value axioms
- 允许自杀吗？享乐主义者可能会接受自杀或安乐死作为逃避痛苦的一种方式。在极端情况下，从全球自杀中解脱出来的全球痛苦在享乐主义极端中是可以接受的(参见消极功利主义)。穆斯林可能会将自杀式炸弹袭击视为捍卫圣地、宗教法律或受压迫人口的殉难形式。教条主义的价值学家可能会将自我杀害视为不可剥夺的自决权。另一方面，他也可能认为这是一种不可原谅的过错。它仅仅取决于对内在价值公理的任意选择。
- Where does the protected life begin? At formation of sex cells, at conception, at birth, or at reaching self-awareness? National abortion debates show how divisive the issue is
- 受保护的生命从哪里开始呢？在性细胞形成时，在受孕时，在出生时，还是在达到自我意识时？全国性的堕胎辩论显示了这个问题的分歧有多大
- Is killing admissible as a form of punishment? Again death penalty debate shows wild differences even among people with seemingly same religious or philosophical convictions. Even if we accept killing for punishment, what kind of crime justifies death penalty? Islamic Sharia court in Nigeria may call for death as a punishment for adultery. Texas law will raise the bar for most outrageous crimes against life. European Union outlawed death penalty altogether. Even if we agree that death is a suitable penalty for a given crime, what form of death is acceptable? Merciful lethal injection, hair raising electric chair, or stoning by village peers?
- 杀戮可以作为惩罚的一种形式吗？死刑辩论再一次显示出巨大的差异，即使在宗教或哲学信仰看似相同的人之间也是如此。即使我们接受杀戮作为惩罚，什么样的罪行才能证明死刑是正当的呢？尼日利亚的伊斯兰教法法庭可能会要求判处死刑，作为对通奸的惩罚。德克萨斯州的法律将提高最骇人听闻的危害生命罪的门槛。欧盟完全宣布死刑为非法。即使我们同意死刑对于特定的罪行是合适的刑罚，什么形式的死亡是可以接受的呢？仁慈的注射死刑，竖起头发的电椅，还是被村里的同龄人用石头砸死？
- Is killing admissible as a form of saving life? Can we kill one person to save lives of two? If not, how about saving a city? Or a continent? Or the whole mankind? Can value of Saddam Hussein's life be judged negative if he threatens others with weapons of mass destruction?
- 杀戮可以作为拯救生命的一种形式吗？我们能杀一个人来救两个人的命吗？如果不是，那拯救一座城市呢？或者是一块大陆？还是全人类？如果萨达姆·侯赛因以大规模杀伤性武器威胁他人，他的生命价值会被认为是负面的吗？

Even if we universally agree that killing is bad, we can still stand worlds apart as for moral judgments in individual cases. For one person, abortion is the trampling on the sanctity of human life while eating pork or beef is a natural course of nature. For another, killing a defenseless animal is an abominable crime while the act of abortion is seen as discarding a mass of cells devoid of self-awareness or ability to sense pain. Why does a British pork eater revolt against a Filipino eating dog meat? Why killing a dog is barbarous while killing a sad-eyed sheep is not? The bridge between the two can be drawn through meticulous analysis only if there is an agreement on the concept of intrinsic value. Still the analysis may be too complex for agreement to ever be feasible.

即使我们普遍认为杀人是坏事，但就个别案件的道德判断而言，我们仍然可以站在不同的世界。对一个人来说，堕胎是对生命神圣性的践踏，而吃猪肉或牛肉是自然的过程。另一方面，杀害手无寸铁的动物是一种令人憎恶的罪行，而堕胎行为则被视为抛弃了大量缺乏自我意识或感知痛苦能力的细胞。为什么一个吃猪肉的英国人反对菲律宾人吃狗肉?为什么杀一条狗是野蛮的，而杀一只伤心的羊却不是?只有在内在价值的概念上达成一致，才能通过细致的分析来搭建两者之间的桥梁。不过，这种分析可能过于复杂，无法达成一致。

The complexity of ethical analysis makes seemingly incompatible conclusions come from individual systems of value. A hedonist might try to apply [Bentham's felicific calculus](http://www.xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=552278) to formalize his statements on value. A scientific axiologist may try to use [Hartman Value Profile](http://www.hartmaninstitute.org/html/AustinHVP.htm). Yet ethics is far from being a hard science even if we stand on the assumption that the intrinsic value is known. For starters, how do we quantify intrinsic value?

伦理分析的复杂性使得来自个体价值体系的结论看似不相容。享乐主义者可能会尝试应用边沁精妙的微积分来形式化他关于价值的陈述。科学价值学家可能会尝试使用哈特曼的价值轮廓。然而，即使我们假设伦理学的内在价值是已知的，伦理学也远不是一门硬科学。首先，我们如何量化内在价值？

Let's us analyze an interesting example. Daniel Pouzzner proposed a concept of [innovism](http://www.mega.nu:8080/innovism.html). Building upon innovism, he structured a universal innovist [constitution](http://www.mega.nu:8080/webconst/top.html) compliant with his philosophy. In our classification of the systems of value, innovism would fall under dogmatic axiology, where the underlying value axiom elects the intrinsic value in the form of progress, development, evolution, innovation, cooperation, competition, and/or creativity. So defined pluralistic axiomatic intrinsic value would certainly find many followers in the present technically-minded society. However, Pouzzner goes on to derive a complex system of philosophical assertions that will surprise those who might agree with the underlying value axiom. While it might seem world government would be the simplest way towards the incorporation of all humanity in an effort to promote innovation and progress, Pouzzner opposes globalization and proposes isolation of non-innovist nations and war where "global good" (e.g. the state of the environment) is threatened. Elsewhere, Pouzzner devoutly promotes self-armament or surprisingly compares Richard Dawkins, author of *"The Selfish Gene"*, to Hitler. Although you might believe that some forms of eugenics could be seen as progressive (e.g. genetic screening of spermatides as a form of preventing genetic diseases), Pouzzner writes: *"Dawkins, with his proposal that 'we are in the unique position of being able to use our brains to work out together the kind of society in which we want to live', has simply restated the core premise of positivism - the philosophical stance responsible for the Holocaust"*. According to Pouzzner, Robert Wright's call to deontological altruisms leads to a terrain already *"well-trod by many murderous religions"*.

让我们来分析一个有趣的例子。丹尼尔·普兹纳(Daniel Pouzzner)提出了创新主义的概念。在创新精神的基础上，他构建了符合他的哲学的普遍创新主义宪法。在我们的价值体系分类中，创新主义属于教条价值论，其中潜在的价值公理选择了以进步、发展、进化、创新、合作、竞争和/或创造力的形式存在的内在价值。这样定义的多元公理内在价值，在当今科技社会一定会有很多追随者。然而，Pouzzner继续推导出一个复杂的哲学断言系统，这将使那些可能同意潜在价值公理的人感到惊讶。虽然世界政府似乎是将全人类纳入努力促进创新和进步的最简单方式，但普兹纳反对全球化，并建议孤立非创新主义国家，并在“全球利益”(例如，环境状况)受到威胁的情况下发动战争。在其他地方，Pouzzner虔诚地提倡自我武装，或者令人惊讶地将“自私基因”的作者理查德·道金斯与希特勒相提并论。尽管你可能认为某些形式的优生学可以被视为进步的(例如，对精子细胞进行基因筛查，以此作为预防遗传病的一种形式)，但Pouzzner写道：“道金斯的提议‘我们处于能够用我们的大脑共同研究出我们想要生活的那种社会的独特位置’，只是重申了实证主义的核心前提-对大屠杀负责的哲学立场”。根据Pouzzner的说法，罗伯特·赖特(Robert Wright)对道义论利他主义的呼吁导致了一个已经“被许多杀戮的宗教很好地践踏”的领域。

For similar reasons, other philosophies with a seemingly related core (human life as intrinsic value, objectivism, etc.) arrive at conclusions that [vegetarianism is evil](http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Evil_Vegetarianism.html), or [altruism is "malevolent"](http://www.neo-tech.com/advantages/advantage13.html), or that public schools are *["the worst violations of individual rights in existence"](http://solohq.com/Objectivism101/Bloody_PublicSchools.shtml)*, or that [America goes on the same path as Nazi Germany](http://www.peikoff.com/op/home.htm).

出于类似的原因，其他具有看似相关核心的哲学(作为内在价值的人的生命、客观主义等)得出这样的结论：素食是邪恶的，利他主义是“恶毒的”，公立学校是“现存最严重的侵犯个人权利的行为”，或者美国走上了与纳粹德国相同的道路。

In other words, even if we agree on the core intrinsic value, we might still derive countless philosophical systems based on the same core. The difference will always rest on the differences in individual knowledge (wherever emotion or genes do not result in an additional bias). Two mathematicians can start with the same set of premises and derive entirely different set of assertions by the choice of derivation as well as through error. The same refers to meta-ethics; particularly that it is far less formalized than the calculus.

换言之，即使我们在核心内在价值上达成一致，我们也可能在同一核心上衍生出无数的哲学体系。这种差异总是取决于个人知识的差异(只要情感或基因不会导致额外的偏见)。两个数学家可以从相同的前提集开始，通过选择推导以及通过错误来推导出完全不同的断言集。元伦理学也是如此，特别是它远没有微积分那么形式化。

Our search for universal ethical system seems like only beginning. Those examples show how far we are from a universal ethical reconciliation. Yet you will easily notice that knowledge is a remedy against the most extreme cases of departure from what we common-sensically or traditionally consider ethical.

我们对普世伦理体系的探索似乎才刚刚开始。这些例子表明，我们距离普遍的道德和解还有很长的路要走。然而，你会很容易地注意到，知识是一种针对最极端的背离我们常识或传统上认为的道德的案例的补救措施。

## Conclusion: knowledge and the sense of life

## 结语：知识与生命的意义

When staking a claim on what is valuable, we have to be aware of our tremendous ignorance in the area of value and morals. Although it has been nearly two centuries ago, what Pierre-Simon de Laplace said still holds true for axiology and science in general: *What we know is not much. What we do not know is immense.* That awareness should makes us spare no effort in the search for the truth. If we agree that statistically knowledge is good, we shall see no limit for further exploration.

当我们主张什么是有价值的东西时，我们必须意识到我们在价值和道德领域的巨大无知。虽然已经过去了近两个世纪，但皮埃尔-西蒙·德·拉普拉斯(Pierre-Simon de Laplace)所说的话对价值论和一般科学仍然适用：我们知道的东西并不多。我们不知道的东西是巨大的。这种觉悟应该使我们不遗余力地寻求真理。如果我们同意统计学知识是好的，我们将看到进一步探索的无限空间。

On the way, we may need to grapple with and dismiss skeptical positions such as:

在此过程中，我们可能需要努力克服和摒弃诸如以下的怀疑立场：

- *What if the truth appears to be bad?* We are supposed to determine which choices, if any, are better than others. The evaluation of the reality is irrelevant in that matter. However bad the truth, if some choices are better (more ethical), we should elect them
- 如果真相看起来不好怎么办？我们应该确定哪些选择(如果有的话)比其他选择更好。在那件事上，对现实的评估是无关紧要的。不管事实多么糟糕，如果有些选择更好(更合乎道德)，我们就应该选他们。
- *What if we are determined at the quantum level and deprived of free will?* If the course of the thought is deterministic, I cannot help but write the above text, and express my beliefs as stated. We have no choice but to act as if free will existed. With today's knowledge, free will debate is irrelevant from the point of view of meta-ethics. Deterministic or not, the quest for new knowledge seems inevitable
- 如果我们在量子层面上被决定，并且被剥夺了自由意志呢？如果思想的进程是确定性的，我会情不自禁地写下上面的文字，并表达我的信仰。我们别无选择，只能像自由意志存在一样行事。以今天的知识，从元伦理学的观点来看，自由意志辩论是无关紧要的。不管是不是确定性的，对新知识的追求似乎是不可避免的。
- *If we are to be rational to decide the moral, why should we be rational in the first place?* Rational means best available by decision of reason. We decide to be rational once we connect action with its consequences. We avoid burning our fingers. In other words, we want to be rational because rationality yields optimum choices. Ultimately and by definition, we want our moral choices to be rational too
- 如果我们要理性地决定道德，为什么我们首先要理性呢？理性意味着通过理性的决定才能获得最好的结果。一旦我们将行动与其后果联系起来，我们就决定变得理性。我们避免烫伤手指。换句话说，我们想要理性，因为理性会产生最佳选择。归根结底，根据定义，我们希望我们的道德选择也是理性的。

Stephen Hawking in *"A Brief History of Time"* wrote a sentence that probably appeals to representatives of a whole spectrum of value systems: those who believe in science, those who believe in God, as well as those who simply find joy in human achievement. This ecumenical statement of value goes as follows: *"If we do discover a complete theory [fundamental theory of nature], it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason, for then we would know the mind of God"*.

斯蒂芬·霍金(Stephen Hawking)在“时间简史”(A Brief History Of Time)中写下的一句话可能会吸引各种价值体系的代表：那些相信科学的人，那些相信上帝的人，以及那些简单地从人类成就中找到乐趣的人。这种普世价值的表述是这样的：“如果我们真的发现了一个完整的理论(自然界的基本理论)，它迟早应该是每个人都能广泛理解的，而不仅仅是几个科学家。这样，我们所有的哲学家、科学家和普通人都可以参与讨论为什么我们和宇宙存在的问题。如果我们找到了这个问题的答案，那将是人类理性的终极胜利，因为那样我们就能了解上帝的思想了。”

## Summary 摘要

1. We have no choice but to assume that (1) our senses provide input that can be validated by modeling reality, and (2) two contradictory things cannot be true at the same time
2. Studying the only-available reality modeled on our sensory input helps us reveal the only-available truth. That truth also includes assertions on the concept of value
3. As long as [intrinsic value](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Goodness_of_knowledge#intrinsic) cannot be determined by the scientific method, we can use the concept of probabilistic value that can validate our actions. Value of choices is then probabilistically determined by the elusive hope of determining intrinsic value in the future through a radical change of our [model](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Model) of reality (see: [Intrinsically Valuable State](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intrinsically_Valuable_State))
4. Knowledge carries probabilistic value as a tool of predicating on the truth and value
5. Mankind's effort to search for the truth carries probabilistic value. This value translates into the support for global progress and development in education, medicine, science, technology, philosophy, etc.
6. Knowledge helps reconcile philosophical systems: hedonistic, religious, deontological, existential, agnostic, skeptical, etc. Knowledge helps universal ethical reconciliation
7. The main enemy of the truth is the negative emotion: hate, anger, envy, malice, etc. The greatest friend of the truth is broad, all-encompassing, open-minded education



1. 我们别无选择，只能假设:(1)我们的感觉提供了可以通过建模现实验证的输入，(2)两件相互矛盾的事情不可能同时成立
2. 以我们的感官输入为模型，研究唯一可用的现实，有助于我们揭示唯一可用的真相。真理也包括对价值概念的主张
3. 只要内在价值不能用科学的方法来确定，我们就可以用概率值的概念来验证我们的行为。通过彻底改变我们的现实模型来确定未来的内在价值(见:内在价值状态)，这种难以捉摸的希望决定了选择的价值。
4. 知识作为判断真理和价值的工具，承载着概率价值
5. 人类对真理的探索具有概率价值。这种价值转化为对全球教育、医学、科学、技术、哲学等领域进步和发展的支持。
6. 知识有助于调和哲学体系:享乐主义、宗教主义、义务主义、存在主义、不可知论、怀疑主义等等。知识有助于实现普遍的伦理和解
7. 真理的主要敌人是消极的情绪:仇恨、愤怒、嫉妒、恶意等。26、真理最伟大的朋友是博大、无所不包、思想开放的教育

**Knowledge helps us understand each other and look for the [universal theory of value](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intrinsically_Valuable_State)**

知识帮助我们相互理解，寻找普遍的价值论。
