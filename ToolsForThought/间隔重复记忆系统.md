# 间隔重复记忆系统

原文：[Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC)

A spaced-repetition memory system combines the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z45mhbpabsigFceeSiRyDXZdvcRqvE2A1xMsn) and the [Spacing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5oCe7JTrkYfmb6SHE4n5HxisE7PdwS6nmXEw) to enable efficient memorization of many thousands of facts ([Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5rVJfPsyCU3pHBbhwef9DNR5fohTHCQFJWir)). Some people also use them for a broader set of tasks (see below). [Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bR1HVvDUhMXDm5SJB4Tiw4xGbrm9AfXWgbc), but they’re not just for rote facts: [Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6UZP7P4sRNgRKSvNj7tMV5uW6dDhwwbdZCy9).

间隔重复记忆系统结合了[测试效应](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z45mhbpabsigFceeSiRyDXZdvcRqvE2A1xMsn)和[间隔效应](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5oCe7JTrkYfmb6SHE4n5HxisE7PdwS6nmXEw)，能够用于高效地记忆成千上万的事实（[间隔重复记忆系统非常高效](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5rVJfPsyCU3pHBbhwef9DNR5fohTHCQFJWir)）。有些人还将它们用于更广泛的任务（见下文）。《[间隔重复记忆系统使记忆成为一种选择](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bR1HVvDUhMXDm5SJB4Tiw4xGbrm9AfXWgbc)》，但它们不只是用于背诵事实：《[间隔重复记忆系统可用于加深概念理解](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6UZP7P4sRNgRKSvNj7tMV5uW6dDhwwbdZCy9)》。

The first consumer system of this kind was [Supermemo](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6Bub13H3u5SKX7Yzbt8GBuK86HPTXSU1TdAK), created by [Piotr Wozniak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7ErFZbV91EoBMFNNRseVh3xk1AeJhwq3fZzS). It adopted and popularized the term “spaced repetition”; prior literature had used a variety of terms (often referring to more specific facets of the underlying phenomenon).

这类系统中，第一个面向消费者的是 [Supermemo](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6Bub13H3u5SKX7Yzbt8GBuK86HPTXSU1TdAK)，由 [Piotr Wozniak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7ErFZbV91EoBMFNNRseVh3xk1AeJhwq3fZzS) 创造。它使用并推广了「间隔重复」这一术语；之前的文献使用了各种术语（通常指的是基本现象更具体的方面）。

- Mnemonic medium
  - The mnemonic medium embeds a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) within narrative prose. [Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bR1HVvDUhMXDm5SJB4Tiw4xGbrm9AfXWgbc), but they’ve suffered significant barriers to adoption. The mnemonic medium is designed to solve many of these problems.
- Spaced repetition systems can be used to program attention
  - [Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bR1HVvDUhMXDm5SJB4Tiw4xGbrm9AfXWgbc), but the computerized component’s value lies specifically in dynamically scheduling and selecting questions to be reviewed. In some sense, the efficacy of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) comes from its power to *program your attention* ([Programmable attention](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zJrfPCbY7GcpV9asEc8NTVzXTAV4TvRFMuY6)). Think: “{cron} for your mind.”
- Knowledge work should accrete
  - A [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) achieves this for memory: when you find information useful, you can invest a little effort to make sure you always have it available. Over time, one’s spaced repetition library accumulates thousands of questions, and (I strongly suspect) that knowledge makes it easier to be an effective knowledge worker later.
- Execute Program
  - Execute Program offers interactive lessons on programming tools by [Gary Bernhardt](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4S7bk6dvuUUHrBUP58cn94r2zpUFfkBuUU7N). The lessons interleave prose with live programming problems. Akin to the [Mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4rRX3qwSSJRsEkdXKwH2shamgHNeRthrMLiF), the site integrates a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) to repeat lessons’ tasks over time.
- Spacing effect
  - [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) algorithms taken advantage of this to implement efficient learning systems.
- Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient
  - Using a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), you can memorize the answers thousands of questions in just a few minutes a day. This is the unintuitive consequence of an exponential at work in the [Spacing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5oCe7JTrkYfmb6SHE4n5HxisE7PdwS6nmXEw): [Spaced repetition yields exponential returns for small increases in effort](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7AeS1H6h8GRAaZ9ZuqumphVu1LNM323rdS6u).
- Quizlet
  - Quizlet is a commercial [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC).
- Elaborative encoding
  - Some [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) users explicitly write prompts to promote elaborative encoding. Experiments by Karpicke and Smith (2012) suggest this may not be adding much, vs. retrieval practice alone. Related: [Retrieval practice appears to be a more effective learning activity than elaborative encoding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6z7GhYwjvT6eYbBDQgUbmcshywmskqnVs3Y6).
- Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice
  - One fascinating consequence of using a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) is that they **make memory a choice.** Once you’ve adopted a memory practice, if you want to remember something, you can simply cause it to happen: just take a few moments to write a question about it. Over the next few weeks, you’ll encode it durably into long-term memory. Moreover, it’ll only take you a few minutes cumulatively: [Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5rVJfPsyCU3pHBbhwef9DNR5fohTHCQFJWir). So not only do these systems make memory a choice, but they make the choice very low-stakes: [Deciding to remember something with a spaced repetition system is a lightweight gesture](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2vBgMKvhXq9yM4wMR3uuQVsqJRarfbfbEoWr).
- Writing good spaced repetition memory prompts is hard
  - People regard flashcards as something trivial from their school days, so they don’t take writing them very seriously. But it’s awfully hard to write good prompts for a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC). For example, good prompts:
- Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to prompt application, synthesis, and creation
  - A [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) like Anki is primarily designed to help people memorize a lot of declarative knowledge, like vocabulary. But the same mechanisms can be used to create relatively unorthodox cards which prompt application, synthesis, and creation.
- Programmable attention
  - The review sessions of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) don’t just help you remember things: it orchestrates your repeated attention over time across hundreds of tiny tasks, too many to manage by hand. Systems like these are a form of *programmable attention*. You use simpler forms of programmable attention all the time: inboxes with snooze and alarm features; bots which remind you of things; [Twitter is a kind of programmable attention](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5UF8YjTjoYiADeLv2SeBPgKXKosK17cKfUpw). What is the core properties of such systems? What is their potential reach?
- Similarities and differences between evergreen note-writing and Zettelkasten
  - I’ve embedded a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) into my notes: [The mnemonic medium can be extended to one’s personal notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5ARNXtS5VxteskEW91S1yYTgAcLABNXsZuJE). This has substantially changed the medium, but in ways I don’t yet understand very well.
- The mnemonic medium can be extended to one’s personal notes
  - In using a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), you’ll fill it with notes on what you’re learning, observing, and thinking. Unfortunately, [Existing spaced repetition systems discourage evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zZuqUv3XNEFsimMmHszLF87Pr5vTraLjL5Y). A memory system will help you retain and continuously engage with what you write, but it won’t much help you build on those ideas over time. An [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) system will help you build on your ideas over time, but it won’t help you retain and continuously engage with those notes (outside of [Evergreen note maintenance approximates spaced repetition](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6yfTwYekzvBkVjeH7WBUrSAJhyGTMYDAyYW7)). So you’re stuck either duplicating your efforts messily in two separate systems, or giving up one system’s benefits.

Lessons only unlock once {all their dependencies have not only been read, but also recently reviewed (via embedded [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) mechanisms)}.

Includes support for various related personal information management systems, such as [Incremental reading](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2gZooHVxB8x6EbDSR97Bz1jFMqAqSWSLPnMs).
- Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding
  - The most obvious way to use a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) is to memorize simple facts: names, definitions, numerical constants, etc. The vast majority of memory system users appear to only ever use them for this purpose. But spaced repetition isn’t just useful for memorizing simple facts. The same mechanism can be used to deeply understand complex material, particularly if you write our own prompts ([How important is it to write your own spaced repetition memory prompts?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5TxQNCUTSAiTg42v7Ft6xASpnyiuvm6phAoJ)). Such conceptually-oriented prompts might test you on connections, implications, causes, consequences. These broader ideas don’t naively feel like facts which can be memorized—but they often are. Besides the benefit of memorizing these conceptual ideas, engaging with higher-level relationships in this way over time can keep you in contact with the topic and help you internalize it more deeply. (related: [The mnemonic medium keeps readers in contact with material over time](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7tjqSxGsJ53tXsGkRpchsECWcMsW3sFUw86U))
- OS-level spaced repetition system
  - What if there were an “OS-level” [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC)? What if, rather than living “inside an app’s shoebox”, as in Anki and other existing tools, prompts were framed more like files in folders—readable and writable throughout the system?
- Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to develop or change habits
  - You could memorize pieces of this with a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), but you can also use the same system to help “install” this habit in your mind. Here are some example questions you might try:

  - Defunct startup which attempted to sell a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) as a service to companies, for training purposes. The CEO was {[Brian Tobal](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6YhUjKr3xGchwqy8tPSApHLcTCH5zEqHctUw)}.
- Unusual applications of spaced repetition memory systems
  - While a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) like Anki is primarily designed to help people remember facts, their flashcard mechanism can be used for a variety of other purposes.
- The critical thing to optimize in spaced repetition memory systems is emotional connection to the review session and its contents
  - Many researchers are trying to make a more efficient [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), but I believe that the critical thing to optimize is *emotional connection to the review session and its contents*—and conversely, to ruthlessly minimize elements which provoke a sigh. These systems, left to their natural inclinations, naturally decay to produce dutiful sessions which feel disconnected from anything that matters to you.
- Mochi
  - [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) is a web-based Markdown-centric [Note-writing system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8XrKGDz49o6XxEx7tzGewzrXQnw6jSgv3Yyf) with an integrated [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC).
- Readwise
  - They’ve gradually introduced some features of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC). In the course of reading through your daily highlights, you can smoothly “upgrade” the interesting ones into cloze deletions or even custom question/answer prompts. This is a clever strategy for onboarding people new to spaced repetition: the product delivers (slight) value if you’re totally passive, but as users become invested, they can apply incremental effort over time and get more out of the product.
- Spaced repetition memory prompts should be written to discourage shallow “pattern matching”
  - One challenge for the efficacy of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) is that sometimes users memorize answers to questions shallowly, through “pattern matching,” rather than by integrating the knowledge more deeply or actually thinking about the question. But [Spaced repetition memory prompts should ensure reviewers must retrieve answers from memory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7XLLk9aqBtJLDtP9kemBA87bDtjhpxst1osT).
- Spaced repetition review sessions often become boring and detached without a steady stream of new prompts
  - Daily practice with a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) should feel vital, relevant. When one hasn’t added many new prompts in a while, the daily review sessions begin to feel stuck in the past, disconnected from what you’re thinking about right now. This appears to be a common failure mode for new users, who add many new prompts at once in a fit of initial enthusiasm, then feel bored when they’re still reviewing those same prompts (and no others) months later.
- Two-component model of memory
  - In practical use as part of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), a third parameter for item complexity must generally be introduced, since SRS items are generally not actually atomic, as far as our brains are concerned.
- Spaced repetition memory systems can accelerate the unpleasant early stages of learning a subject
  - One common negative reaction to working with a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) is: “I’d much rather get my hands dirty: then I’ll naturally end up remembering whatever’s important.” ([Enabling environments focus on creating opportunities for growth and action, not on skill-building](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5th5bWm6VhB6PPbYB97gUKMdnaZe5atntRza)) But when you’re first interacting with a new subject, it’s hard to take any meaningful steps at all: at least for a while, you often can’t hold enough of the new terms and ideas in your head simultaneously long enough to do anything meaningful (related: [Novices in enabling environments often can’t do what’s enabled](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3XsSKarN8i3pV4WjPiJ7pVGG6akRVQvU7ngK)). In this context, a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) can help by accelerating you through this awkward, unpleasant stage to the point where you can actually have a meaningful experience with the material (related: [Enabling environments’ activities directly serve an intrinsically meaningful purpose](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7wh92mfgXNTLk8AhaaLxsViQuzqGY5cV56Vm)).
  - One common negative reaction to working with a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) is: “I’d much rather get my hands dirty: then I’ll naturally end up remembering whatever’s important.” ([Enabling environments focus on creating opportunities for growth and action, not on skill-building](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5th5bWm6VhB6PPbYB97gUKMdnaZe5atntRza)) But when you’re first interacting with a new subject, it’s hard to take any meaningful steps at all: at least for a while, you often can’t hold enough of the new terms and ideas in your head simultaneously long enough to do anything meaningful (related: [Novices in enabling environments often can’t do what’s enabled](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3XsSKarN8i3pV4WjPiJ7pVGG6akRVQvU7ngK)).

- Sana Labs
  - an integrated [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) suggests re-review at a later date
  - I imagine that there will be some [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) component, given the big retention circle.
- Spaced repetition memory systems make you feel like your memory is worse than it really is
  - One challenge for the adoption and day-to-day experience of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) is that you will spend almost all of your review time on material which you find difficult to remember. Easily-remembered material will rapidly accelerate to intervals of many months, so you’ll spend little time on that, compared to a prompt which is stuck at days-or-weeks-length intervals. Your expected accuracy rate across your entire collection may be 95+%, but your accuracy rate in a given session is likely to be much lower.
- Spaced repetition systems as catechism
  - Likewise, a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC)’s review sessions help readers remember the material of a book, but they also trigger readers to re-engage with material they’ve read over time. That’s practically useful because many readers will see new connections after they’ve sat with the content for a few weeks. But maybe it also fosters a change in identity: you’re not just a person who read that essay one time, you’re a “student of that topic” in some more continuous sense.
- Studying another person’s spaced repetition memory prompts is usually ineffective
  - Once one understands that [Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bR1HVvDUhMXDm5SJB4Tiw4xGbrm9AfXWgbc) and that [Learning increasingly complex ideas may amount to forming larger effective chunk sizes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8VFVdTR19snWjFMxnyNabBCbmeoWrQ287TdT), it’s awfully tempting to gobble up new knowledge by downloading others’ decks of [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) prompts. But assuming you’ve never studied it before, you’re much better off reading a textbook chapter on cell biology than you would be memorizing someone else’s deck.
- Spaced repetition memory prompts should encode ideas from multiple angles
  - Flashcards, like those of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), get a deservedly bad reputation in part because they remind people of rote school learning. People remember being forced to memorize isolated facts like the names of different categories of cloud—and they remember parroting back those answers without building any enduring understanding. Part of the problem is that [Educational objectives often subvert themselves](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6qfYv9SPx6M9FZPzVj7o4qVRD1iTGJpMfz6J): you probably didn’t really care about learning that material. But that issue aside, these isolated exercises are particularly brittle because they develop knowledge which can only be used in one context, disconnected from broader conceptual frameworks and understandings: [Rich understanding is about connection](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8LFKKV15V11DpHdrybyvcaXcVfcRNqVqVCTD).
- Salience of improvement drives skill development
  - I suspect that this is one key reason why [People generally develop skills to a plateau and then stop](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5gHroEM2vM2WcKxkdcsCw8qv5tmHSbBVxEb4), and in particular why [Athletes and musicians pursue virtuosity in fundamental skills much more rigorously than knowledge workers do](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4qhD8UwNAmJDdJUC36BUGp5PEUfgfzZXvkhB). If you’ve never heard of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), it’s probably not obvious that memory can be made a solved problem. If you’ve never heard of [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), it’s probably not obvious that [Knowledge workers usually have no specific methods for developing ideas over time](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2A9r2zcddVXfxjevj5Nzayhwxr9VuycjxYdz).
- Spaced repetition memory systems don’t rapidly demonstrate their benefits
  - [Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5rVJfPsyCU3pHBbhwef9DNR5fohTHCQFJWir), but the curves start shallow. So a new user’s experience with a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) is front-loaded in terms of effort… and delayed in terms of powerful results. Initially, it seems no better than a trivial flashcard system which they might have used in school. And the long-term benefit is very non-obvious: [Spaced repetition yields exponential returns for small increases in effort](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7AeS1H6h8GRAaZ9ZuqumphVu1LNM323rdS6u), but almost nothing else does, and [People have poor intuitions for exponentials](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7ovyasYVEW4BS9Ay1V6iLCDVSfhPrkGyU3R3).
- RemNote
  - [RemNote](https://www.remnote.io/homepage) is a web-based [Note-writing system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8XrKGDz49o6XxEx7tzGewzrXQnw6jSgv3Yyf) with a structured knowledge model and first-class operations for adapting notes into a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), a la [The mnemonic medium can be extended to one’s personal notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5ARNXtS5VxteskEW91S1yYTgAcLABNXsZuJE).
- Spaced repetition memory systems help you focus on deeper engagement by automating away rote memorization
  - [Deep understanding requires detailed knowledge of fundamentals](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQiumA4k3SXo1GeRVJpsrVaBRETAoyYmSERS). One way to view the role of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), then, is that they efficiently automate away the essential but rote elements of learning so that you can focus on more interesting, meaningful, or conceptual elements.
- Regular spaced repetition memory practice is an onerous habit to adopt
  - So a successful [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) must deliver significant personal value immediately to overcome this barrier to adoption. Most systems don’t: they’re an empty box meant for the user to fill. But [Writing good spaced repetition memory prompts is hard](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3ntJ7w9C3uapYp1m3gy2EK6PN788guzEoUNN), so most users’ initial review sessions will comprise a small number of mediocre prompts. And [Spaced repetition memory systems don’t rapidly demonstrate their benefits](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2evK9drA5aJp4tHcXgV4Pri6GAnEyWyb4YwS). So people churn.
- Spaced repetition memory prompts should usually focus on one atomic unit
  - If you’ve just learned a new way to cook peas, you might write a prompt for a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) like: “Q. How do I cook peas sous vide?” “A. 18m @ 70°C”. But I find that questions like this are usually a struggle—I’ll frequently forget the answer. Questions which draw on multiple independent ideas seem to trip over this problem.
- Spaced repetition memory prompts should connect and relate ideas
  - When using a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) to learn facts, the naive approach leads to learning a lot of facts in isolation: the name of a protein, the date of an event, the size of a physical constant. But because [Rich understanding is about connection](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8LFKKV15V11DpHdrybyvcaXcVfcRNqVqVCTD), it’s better to relate these facts to other ideas. This will both help you remember more reliably (due to [Elaborative encoding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3ZTBNhJddpewTBgbKAFy2cnSMBiJRpMZWsfB)) but also help you develop a richer understanding that goes beyond simple facts.
- Spaced repetition memory prompts should be concise
  - Related to but distinct from [Spaced repetition memory prompts should usually focus on one atomic unit](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8kPjeqPqJwLwqdVqPYBBTwfU3aczsFyvXFmx), it’s generally best to keep [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) prompts concise.
- Conceptual information may have much slower optimal spaced repetition schedules
  - Almost all the prior literature on the [Spacing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5oCe7JTrkYfmb6SHE4n5HxisE7PdwS6nmXEw) and on naturalistic applications of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) concern declarative information like word pairs, term definitions, or simple property values. I suspect that conceptual information, densely linked to prior and related knowledge, will exhibit very different memory dynamics.
- Self-grading vs. machine-grading in spaced repetition memory systems
  - In a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), the key input to the control system is: did the user remember the prompt correctly? Some systems are self-graded: the user indicates whether they remembered or not. Others ask the user to input the answer; then the system computes whether the user was correct.
- Spaced repetition memory prompts should unambiguously produce a specific answer
  - When writing prompts for a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), it’s easy to accidentally write a question which has correct answers besides the one you intend. You must include enough context that reasonable alternative answers are clearly wrong, while not including so much context that you violate concision ([Spaced repetition memory prompts should be concise](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zysh2vANAg4bFAqaR5KmwzSR3oe7ybDj465e)) or encourage pattern matching ([Spaced repetition memory prompts should be written to discourage shallow “pattern matching”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6S3cEUXNktEEZEzRqUXh5ivRNMWjJ2nq72Ys)).
- Execute Program doesn’t have non-executable prompts
  - That lesson couldn’t also have this more typical [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) prompt:
- Mnemosyne
  - A popular open-source [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC). The primary developer is {Peter Bienstman}, a Belgian photonics scientist.
- Spaced repetition mechanics create a sense of effortlessness
  - The core mechanics of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) remove decision-making and gumption from the critical path. Say that you’d like to study the molecular pathway of cell metabolism. Without an SRS, you’d need to make a plan like “I study cell biology on Tuesday evenings,” remember that plan, and summon the will to execute the plan repeatedly. But if you have an active SRS practice, you can throw some prompts into your library and be confident that you’ll see them again over time.
- Execute Program’s prompts act both as application prompts and recall prompts
  - The [Mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4rRX3qwSSJRsEkdXKwH2shamgHNeRthrMLiF)’s basic prompt type is an atomic recall prompt in the typical [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) style: highly atomic, strictly testing your memory. By contrast, [Execute Program](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2LGZ8cXBcQMP7YuAHbeVyCSLZoiMXvQNKCok)’s basic prompt type is—or at least looks like—an application prompt (see [The mnemonic medium can help readers apply what they’ve learned through simple application prompts](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6Y8xDS2AJyE1d34X99y14Sk1A7YCNas5kFjA)).
- Thought Saver

Includes support for widgets so that it functions as a host for the [Mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4rRX3qwSSJRsEkdXKwH2shamgHNeRthrMLiF).
- Deciding to remember something with a spaced repetition system is a lightweight gesture
  - People who haven’t actually used a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) often think of it as a tool you might apply “when you want to memorize something.” But this is an awful way to understand how to use an efficient memory system. Without augmentation, explicitly memorizing information is quite onerous, so it’s not something people often do. It’s reserved for extremely important details, details which are worthy of memorization’s high costs.
- Expert response heuristic, after Issa Rice
  - [Issa Rice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPnAxzBTDgjCabaBJkUrjL4roGR1xD1XJvo) [suggests](https://wiki.issarice.com/wiki/Expert_response_heuristic_for_prompt_writing) that one useful heuristic for writing prompts for a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) (and in particular for the [Mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4rRX3qwSSJRsEkdXKwH2shamgHNeRthrMLiF)) is that someone who’s already an expert in that topic should be able to answer the prompt without referring to a specific mnemonic essay or source.
- Chessable MoveTrainer
  - A [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) designed specifically for learning chess moves. It’s integrated with instructional material, alternating prose + visual explanation with quizzes, akin to how [Execute Program’s lessons unfurl their prose in response to reader interaction](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6rN4nbPWxhYMkzt4rixDUoLD2hi2cvtJi2Ay).
- Simple application prompts can be presented the same way as recall prompts in the mnemonic medium
  - Because the experiences of these question types have so much overlap, solutions to the design problems of memory prompts should mostly apply to the design problems of simple application prompts. This suggests that simple application prompts can be presented with little adaptation in the existing review environment of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC).
- How might spaced repetition memory systems intervene when the student struggles with material?
  - The typical [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) does two things: it shortens the interval until the next presentation, and (usually) it asks the student to retry the prompt in the same session.
- Avoid orphan spaced repetition memory prompts
  - When adding prompts to a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), it’s usually a mistake to write prompts about a detail that seems interesting, but which is disconnected from everything else you’re thinking about. [Spaced repetition memory prompts should connect and relate ideas](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z49EwwPL1CzKHTyLHXwJJH7hsciCg772Vm5WJ)—and it’s even better to make them connect and relate to ideas that you’re regularly thinking about.

- Differences in my approach to spaced repetition systems

Collecting notes on some of the key differences in my approach here to help key myself oriented toward high-order bits.
- To what extent does spaced repetition memory system practice constitute deliberate practice?
  - Do the review sessions of a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) constitute [Deliberate practice, after Ericsson](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2duRd5eisRomSgxr88Semkgs15pgMRVVR5C)?
- Vision statement
  - My current research explores *memory systems*—environments which build on powerful ideas from cognitive psychology to make *durably remembering something* into a primitive action. Prior work on memory systems (e.g. [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC)) has focused mostly on explicit memorization of simple facts, like country capitals and key dates. But memory-focused primitives can augment more complex and more meaningful tasks. I’m interested in how they might helpfully suffuse and augment the activities of everyday life—reading, writing, conversation, art. For example, I believe we can create memory systems which make it much easier to learn abstract, conceptual knowledge ([Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6UZP7P4sRNgRKSvNj7tMV5uW6dDhwwbdZCy9)). And I believe these systems can accelerate creative work by helping people internalize key insights and influences.
- How might we situate tools for thought within intrinsically meaningful contexts?
  - What if “practice sessions” for a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) could be excised completely, instead structuring one’s authentic environment so that “practice” naturally occurs through daily actions? e.g. [Twitter is a kind of programmable attention](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5UF8YjTjoYiADeLv2SeBPgKXKosK17cKfUpw); [Evergreen note maintenance approximates spaced repetition](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6yfTwYekzvBkVjeH7WBUrSAJhyGTMYDAyYW7). Related: [The dominant culture around spaced repetition memory systems is fixated on meaningless goals](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7i9vs1MyadFaSkGBSwLVsfsQ5UEdN5aS2v9J).
- Spaced repetition memory prompts should ensure reviewers must retrieve answers from memory
  - A [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) depends on the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z45mhbpabsigFceeSiRyDXZdvcRqvE2A1xMsn): you’ll remember something longer if you have to actually retrieve it from memory than if you’re simply re-exposed to it. So when writing prompts, make sure that the prompt requires the reader to actually retrieve the memory you want to reinforce.
- Spaced repetition prompt design is about designing tasks for your future self
  - [Writing good spaced repetition memory prompts is hard](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3ntJ7w9C3uapYp1m3gy2EK6PN788guzEoUNN), but here’s one useful mental model. When you make a prompt for a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC), you are *giving your future self a recurring task*. Prompt design is task design.
- Duolingo
  - Duolingo is a language learning app with [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) components.
- Existing spaced repetition systems discourage evergreen notes
  - Though notes in a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) are atomic in the same way as [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) ([Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1)), they’re in many ways *too* atomized ([Traditional spaced repetition memory prompts are atomized](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4w269svvGhA2H5XFr6geaBbPTrxtJRpjt5TE)). The form discourages incremental synthesis and distillation.
- The mnemonic medium’s design relies on light-weight prompts
  - **Tiny tasks:** Good recall prompts in a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) test just one thing, so they can be answered quite quickly.

- Missed answers in Execute Program’s reviews don’t penalize the student unless they “give up”
  - [Execute Program](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2LGZ8cXBcQMP7YuAHbeVyCSLZoiMXvQNKCok)’s [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) prompts are machine-graded, so if readers make semantically-unimportant typos in their responses, the system marks the prompt wrong. These false negatives can be quite annoying, particularly since [Execute Program’s lessons don’t unlock until you’ve successfully reviewed their prerequisites](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z43GdwxNzaXGvNs7Hdd57UD9KauMxRGbH45r8). In the SQL course, the false negative rate is high enough that in early 2020, the system was changed so that incorrect responses no longer “count” as failing, so long as the student eventually produces a correct answer. Readers can try as many times as they want, and the next review’s interval will still increase according to the SRS curve. Subsequent lessons unlock irrespective of user performance.
- Avoid yes-no spaced repetition memory prompts
  - Yes/no [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) prompts are an attractive nuisance. Many simple statements you might read are basically saying “X is true.” An apparently easy way to turn that into a question is to ask “Is X true?” But these questions aren’t very useful: [Spaced repetition memory prompts should ensure reviewers must retrieve answers from memory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7XLLk9aqBtJLDtP9kemBA87bDtjhpxst1osT)
- Recall rates are a misleading proxy for more meaningful goals of the mnemonic medium
  - The existing [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) culture’s fixation on often-meaningless memorization makes this failure mode particularly common: [The dominant culture around spaced repetition memory systems is fixated on meaningless goals](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7i9vs1MyadFaSkGBSwLVsfsQ5UEdN5aS2v9J).
- Traditional spaced repetition memory prompts are atomized
  - The prompts in a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) are an unordered, unstructured set. Each prompt is intentionally quite fine-grained and atomic, since that’s what seems to work best for effective memorization. But this lack of structure creates a feeling of wandering through a forest, able to see only one leaf at a time.
- Self-graded spaced repetition memory systems avoid false negatives
  - In a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) review session, if I make a typo in my SQL expression because I’ve misremembered the name of a function, that’s bad and I should probably review the task again. But if I make a typo because my finger slipped, I’m still “right” as frat I’m concerned. False negatives are extremely irritating in machine-graded systems. They’re also inefficient, of course, since the prompt will re-appear sooner. But enraging the user is the much more serious issue.
- How does the mnemonic medium’s efficacy vary across platform-knowledge-style topics?
  - There’s ample experimental data that the [Spacing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5oCe7JTrkYfmb6SHE4n5HxisE7PdwS6nmXEw) applies across many topics, and there’s anecdotal data that a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) can effectively encode material across many topics. We may need domain-specific problem-solving to establish how to encode each topic’s knowledge into prompts.
- Self-graded spaced repetition memory systems are more efficient than machine-graded systems
  - [Interaction is a cost center in interface design](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z87TFgTr98bz3MNFT26NhegyRCMgdkfNTBAzp), so a machine-graded [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) impose greater costs on their users. If the user is meant to type in the answer, that can easily 2-4x the amount of time spent on each task.
- Commercially-successful spaced repetition memory systems are all machine-graded
  - Anki, Mnemosyne, and SuperMemo are self-graded. [Duolingo](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Pi11ZtBxEZDwVwzETHP5TtxtzFWZdCVKWMB), Memrise, and [Quizlet](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4erShe1C2qB39z4r8yDox1FuM2ZhRJxxTXbN) (for the most part) are machine-graded. The [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) products with widespread adoption and significant commercial success are all machine-graded.
- Machine-graded spaced repetition memory systems can perform more advanced knowledge modeling
  - If [Duolingo](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Pi11ZtBxEZDwVwzETHP5TtxtzFWZdCVKWMB) asks me to translate a Spanish phrase into English, and I mistranslate a single word, it can notice *which* word I mistranslated, and adjust the schedule for related tasks accordingly. A self-graded [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) can only know that the entire response was wrong. (Note that I don’t think Duolingo actually does this!)
- Cloze deletions can be used to create typical N-sided flashcards
  - A typical [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) represents cloze deletions separately from front/back flashcards, but it’s interesting to observe that you can think of typical flashcards as a special case of cloze deletions.
- Self-graded spaced repetition memory systems accommodate a wider variety of prompts
  - “Improvise a melody in pentatonic minor.” Many valuable [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) prompts are, to various degrees, fundamentally non-machine-gradable—particularly those described in [Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to prompt application, synthesis, and creation](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zE8PK4UUAAWK6LEcmr8jja8JdxpUxcf1FUCX). Self-graded systems will accommodate these more experimental questions more readily.

  \* I’ll summarize just the second experiment, since it’s more relevant to the kind of [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4eXdSMJFv2qVGXSUEKH4vdcHBrLHcFY1ZGfC) design I’m doing. Students who practiced via short-answer enhanced their recall the most relative to a control condition and a condition in which students simply read the correct answers. Short-answer-practicing students performed better than those who practiced via multiple-choice on a multiple choice post-test (d=0.41) but not significantly better than MC-practicers on a short-answer post-test.
