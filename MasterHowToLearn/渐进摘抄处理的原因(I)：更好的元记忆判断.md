This article is about my rationale behind [Incremental Extract Processing](https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/2019-07-11-what-to-do-after-creating-extracts-in-incremental-reading) introduced. I separated the reasons from that article because I don’t think everyone is interested in knowing the whys, only the hows and whats. In this article I will further elaborate the first benefit of Incremental Extract Processing.

这篇文章是关于我介绍的渐进摘抄处理背后的基本原理。我把原因从那篇文章中分离出来，因为我不认为每个人都有兴趣知道为什么，他们只对怎么样做和是什么感兴趣。在本文中，我将进一步阐述渐进摘抄处理的第一个好处。

TL;DR: When you first make an extract, you don’t have accurate and enough metamemory judgments on what to do with it. If you process an extract immediately, you will tend to make mistakes like making too many clozes. This also strips you the benefits of spaced repetition and the chance of better clozed/Q&A items, which you acquire by Incremental Extract Processing. You will better know what to do with the extracts after some time, due to the power of spaced repetition.

太长不看：当你刚做了一张摘抄卡片时，你对如何处理它没有准确和足够的元记忆判断。如果你立即处理摘抄卡，你将倾向于犯错误，比如挖了太多的空。这也剥夺了你通过渐进摘抄处理获得的间隔重复的好处和更好的填空/问答卡片的机会。由于间隔重复的力量，在一段时间后，你将更好地知道如何处理摘抄卡片。

## Metamemory Judgments In Dealing With Extracts

## 处理摘抄卡片过程中的元记忆判断

All these metamemory judgments and control processes are basically, whether you realize it or not, the underlying thought processes of how you deal with extracts. For example:

不管你是否意识到，所有这些元记忆判断和控制过程基本上都是你如何处理摘抄卡片的潜在思维过程。例如：

`Ease-of-learning (EOL) judgments`: if you think an item is easy to learn, you’ll make fewer clozes or not deserve a Q&A item.

易学性(EOL)判断：如果你认为一个题目容易学，那么你就会少挖空，或者不值得做问答卡片。

`Judgments of learning and Feeling-of-knowing (FOK) judgment`: how you grade an item.

学习判断和知觉(FOK)判断：如何给卡片打分。

`Selection of kind of processing`: whether to process an extract, make cloze(s) or Q&A(s).

加工种类选择：是加工摘抄卡片，还是做填空卡片或问答卡片。

These thought processes are manifested in these actions:

这些思维过程体现在这些行动中：

A. Dismiss it (Ctrl+D):

A. 搁置：

> “I thought it was important but now when I re-read it, I think otherwise.”
>
> 
>
> “我原以为它很重要，但现在当我重读它时，我却不这么认为。”



> “Although it’s not important enough to be further processed, it’s nice to read it once more. Now that I’ve read it, I will dismiss it.”
>
> 
>
> 虽然它还没有重要到需要进一步处理的程度，但能再读一遍还是很不错的。现在我已经读过了，我将搁置它。”

B. Rewrite it, summarize in your own words, then review this extract again later:

B. 重写它，用你自己的话总结，以后再看张摘抄卡片：

> “I know this is important enough to be processed further, yet at the moment I have no idea how to best do so.”
>
> 
>
> “我知道这件事很重要，需要进一步处理，但目前我不知道如何才能最好地这样做。”

C. Turn it into a cloze/Q&A item:

C. 将其转换为填空/问答卡片：

> “This is important and I have solid ideas on what to do.”
>
> 
>
> “这很重要，我对该怎么做有明确的想法。”

Your decisions on what to do with it are all critically dependent on the metamemory judgments. These operations greatly affect your learning quality and efficiency.

你对如何处理它的决定在很大程度上取决于元记忆判断。这些操作极大地影响了你的学习质量和效率。

## Problems with Inferior Metamemory Judgments

## 关于劣质元记忆判断的问题

### Lacking Enough Information to Make Good Decisions

### 缺乏足够的信息来做出正确的决策

Initially, you make extracts because “Well it seems important”. Yet to what degree (the number of clozes/Q&As) and in what formats (cloze/Q&A/both) are mostly fuzzy at this point. You can’t decide wisely on what to do with an extract because you lack the clarity and relevant information to determine it. In other words, you don’t know the extract (or in general, the whole article) well enough to know what to do with it.

最初，你做摘抄是因为“它看起来很重要”。然而，在什么程度上(填空/问答卡片的数量)和什么格式(填空/问答/两者)上，大多是模糊的。你不能明智地决定如何处理摘抄卡片，因为你缺乏确定它的清晰度和相关信息。换句话说，你不知道摘抄卡片(或一般情况下，整篇文章)是否足够好，不知道如何处理它。

In this case, if you immediately process an extract, you’ll tend to make mistakes. For example, for an extract, you should have dismissed it but you made two clozed items instead; you may have dismissed it when it’s actually very important to you, unbeknown to you at that moment. With lowered quality of metamemory judgments, skewed by all the cognitive biases, the resulting clozed/Q&A item(s) is just far from optimal.

在这种情况下，如果你立即处理摘抄卡片，则往往会出错。例如，如果是一张你应该搁置的摘抄卡片，但你却做了两个填空卡片；你可能在当时不知道的情况下，当它对你来说实际上非常重要的时候，你已经搁置了它。随着元记忆判断质量的降低，以及所有认知偏见的歪曲，由此产生的填空/问答卡片远远不是最优的。

## Psychological Barrier from Creating a Clozed/Q&A Item Too Early

## 过早创建填空/问答卡片带来的心理屏障

Once an extract is converted to a clozed/Q&A item, it’s more of less finalized. Sure, you can still modify it. But to me, it has already passed the psychological threshold of “done”:

一旦摘抄卡片转换成填空/问答卡片，它就几乎定稿了。当然，你仍然可以修改它。但对我来说，它已经跨过了“做完”的心理门槛：

I. If it is an extract, I need to further process it: Understanding it, shortening it, providing contextual cues etc. The natural course of action is modification.

如果是摘抄卡片，我需要进一步处理：理解它，缩短它，提供上下文提示等等。自然而然的行动过程是修改。

II. If it is a clozed/Q&A item, the major focus is retrieving the answer. The natural course of action is retrieval of answer.

如果是填空/问答卡片，主要的焦点是回忆答案。自然而然的行动过程是回忆答案。

Therefore, modification is mostly done before it’s turned into a cloze/Q&A item. I don’t normally think whether I should dismiss a cloze/Q&A item, but I do so for extracts. If it’s important enough to be made into a cloze/Q&A item, why should I consider dismissing it? But what I may not realize is that my decision---turning it into a cloze/Q&A item--- can be skewed and wrong in the first place. When turning an extract into a clozed/Q&A items too early, I will then be learning from an inferior item, or even no item should be created in the first place.

因此，修改大多是在它变成填空/问答卡片之前完成的。我通常不会考虑是否应该搁置填空/问答卡片，但我考虑搁置摘抄卡片。如果它足够重要，可以做成填空/问答卡片，我为什么要考虑搁置它呢？但我可能没有意识到的是，我的决定——把它变成填空/问答——从一开始就可能是歪曲和错误的。当过早地将摘抄卡片变成填空/问答卡片时，我就会从劣质卡片中学习，甚至从一开始就不应该创建卡片。

**With insufficient or far from optimal level of understanding of the extracts, all the subsequent clozed/Q&A items produced is just premature creation.** This is like contaminating the bloodline: what is produced afterwards is of inferior quality. Bad decisions on extracts produce bad clozed/Q&A items. You will then be learning and remembering from bad clozed/Q&A items.

**由于对摘抄卡片的理解不充分或远未达到最佳水平，所有随后产生的填空/问答卡片都只是不成熟的创作。**这就像污染的血统：后来生产的东西质量低劣。糟糕的摘抄决策会产生糟糕的填空/问答卡片。然后你将从糟糕的填空/问答卡片中学习和记忆。

## Solution: Let Time Pass, **a.k.a.** Incremental Extract Processing

## 解决方法：让时间流逝，即渐进摘抄处理

Incremental Extract Processing inherently includes spaced repetition: Re-reading the same extract across a period of time is the very definition of spaced repetition. You’ll possess higher quality of metamemory judgments and control processes when you let time pass. On the other hand, processing an extract immediately strips you the benefits of spaced repetition.

渐进摘抄处理本质上包括在间隔重复中：在一段时间内重复阅读相同的摘抄正是间隔重复的定义。当你让时间流逝时，你将拥有更高质量的元记忆判断和控制过程。另一方面，处理摘抄卡片会立即剥夺你间隔重复的好处。

> Each time you rethink structure and formulation, you hone the representation and “connectivity” of a given piece of knowledge in your memory. In addition, your priorities change as you proceed with learning. At times, you will over-invest in a piece of knowledge that quickly becomes irrelevant or out-dated. The incremental approach will reduce the impact of over-investment. - [Incremental Reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading)

> 每次你重新思考结构和表述时，你都会磨练记忆中给定知识的表示和“连通性”。此外，随着学习的进行，你的优先级也会发生变化。有时，你会在一项很快变得无关紧要或过时的知识上过度投资。渐进方式将减少过度投资的影响。——渐进阅读

### Treat an extract like a first date

### 像对待第一次约会一样对待摘抄卡片

An extract is a lot like first date. You can’t determine whether to marry this person because you lack the relevant and important information to make a good judgment. How do you acquire those critical pieces of information? By getting to know this person better. This is the same for extracts. When you make an extract, you don’t have a good grasp on your relationship with it, in the greater scheme of things like:

一张摘抄卡片很像第一次约会。你无法决定是否要和这个人结婚，因为你缺乏相关的重要信息，无法做出良好的判断。你如何获得这些关键的信息？通过更好地了解这个人。摘抄卡片也是如此。当你摘抄的时候，你没有很好地把握你和它的关系，在更大的计划中，比如:

> Do I really need this item? What is the honest priority of this item in the entire spectrum of my (desired) knowledge? Is this item difficult to remember? If so, why? Is it factually correct? Is it as simple and clear as it could be? Do I really need to know it now? Do you need supplementary knowledge to understand all ramifications of the item? - [Incremental Reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading)
>
> 
>
> 我真的需要这件东西吗？在我(想要的)整个知识范围中，这个卡片诚实的优先顺序是什么？这个卡片很难记住吗？若有，原因为何？这是真实的吗？它是不是尽可能的简单明了呢？我真的需要现在就知道吗？你需要补充知识才能理解卡片的所有分支吗？——渐进阅读

If you want to process extracts well, you need to let time pass in order to acquire more and accurate metamemory judgments. With time, you’ll gain clarity and better know what to do with it.

如果你想很好地处理摘抄卡片，就需要让时间流逝，才能获得更多、更准确的元记忆判断。随着时间的推移，你会变得清晰，更清楚地知道该怎么做。

**My point is, you will have far superior quality of all these metamemory judgments and control processes after some time, due to the power of spaced repetition.**

**我的观点是，由于间隔重复的力量，在一段时间后，你将更高质量的元记忆判断和控制处理。**

## Case Study: Two Passive Reviews are Enough

## 案例研究：两次被动复习就足够了

There are extracts that are worth reading more than once, yet not worthy of turning into clozes/Q&A items.

有些摘抄卡片值得多读几遍，但不值得做成填空/问答卡片。

For example, I have the following extract on meditation from [21 Lessons For 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0525512179) by Yuval Noah Harari:

例如，我从尤瓦尔·诺亚·哈拉里(Yuval Noah Harari)的21节课中摘抄了以下关于冥想的内容：

> I was not the CEO – I was barely the gatekeeper. I was asked to stand at the gateway of my body – the nostrils – and just observe whatever comes in or goes out. Yet after a few moments I lost my focus and abandoned my post.
>
> 
>
> 我不是首席执行官--我只是个守门人。我被要求站在我身体的入口处——鼻孔——只观察任何进出的东西。然而，过了一会儿，我就失去了注意力，离开了我的岗位。

[![repetition_history](https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/static/e40e7d6f6bba2ed4caf1bf3bb143a56a/82704/repetition_history.png)](https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/static/e40e7d6f6bba2ed4caf1bf3bb143a56a/82704/repetition_history.png)

As you can see, over the span of a month, I’d made the extract, re-read it twice, then dismissed it. I didn’t remember why I extracted it in the first place, probably because I liked this analogy. I could have made it into a clozed or Q&A item, but I didn’t. If I immediately processed this extract, I might have made this Q&A:

正如你所看到的，在一个月的时间里，我做了摘抄卡片，重读了两遍，然后搁置了它。我不记得一开始我为什么要摘抄它，可能是因为我喜欢这个比喻。我本可以把它做成填空或问答卡片，但我没有。如果我立即处理这张摘抄卡片，我可能会做这样的问答：

```none
Q: Analogy of focusing on the nostrils? (with reference I'll know the relevant context)
A: Being the gatekeeper of the body

问：把注意力放在鼻孔上的比喻是什么？(有了参考资料，我会知道相关的上下文)
答：做身体的守门人
```

After re-reading it twice, I did not think it was worth further processing, so I dismissed it. When passively reviewing an extract later on, even if I don’t turn it into clozes/Q&A items, I still benefit from reading it once more in a spaced repetition manner, hence “remember” more, or at least, enriching that memory trace even a tiny bit.

重读了两遍后，我觉得不值得进一步处理，所以就将其搁置了。在以后被动地复习摘抄卡片时，即使我不把它变成填空/问答卡片，但我仍然可以通过间隔重复的方式再次阅读它，因此我仍然可以受益于再次阅读，从而更多地“记住”，或者至少，哪怕是一点点丰富记忆的痕迹。

## My Old Mentality

## 我以前的心态

I didn’t realize the benefits of Incremental Extract Processing early on. I had the bad habit of immediately processing extracts during Incremental Reading. My steps:

1. Reading an article and making extracts as I go.

2. Before moving on to the next element, if I’ve made 4 extracts, I would turn those 4 extracts into clozes or (rarely) Q&A items.

我以前并没有意识到渐进摘抄处理的好处。我有在渐进阅读时立即处理摘抄的坏习惯。我的步骤：

1. 一边读一篇文章，一边做摘抄。

2. 在进入下一个元素之前，如果我已经做了 4 个摘抄卡片，我会把这 4 个摘抄卡片变成填空卡片或(很少)问答卡片。

My old mentality was that I wanted to “finish” the extracts. I thought the ultimate destiny of an extract was turned into a clozed/Q&A item. Leaving the extracts “hanging” felt like leaving a task unfinished, so why not do it immediately?

我过去的想法是，我想要“完成”摘抄卡片。我以为最终的结局是把摘抄卡片变成一个填空/问答卡片。把这些段落“挂着”就像没有完成一项任务，所以为什么不马上去做呢?

But now I realized this is not true. I can even just dismiss it when SuperMemo shows it to me. If I don’t dismiss it, I don’t even have to process an extract in one go. Rather than compressing the time span, I should do the opposite: extend the time span to take advantage of the power of the spacing effect. Time allows me to put on a new pair of glasses, to review the materials with a fresh perspective. The required judgment at discerning between the signal and the noise are better revealed with the passage of time.

但现在我意识到这不是真的。当 SuperMemo 向我展示它时，我甚至可以将其搁置。如果我不搁置它，我甚至不用一口气处理一张摘抄卡片。与其压缩时间跨度，不如反其道而行之：延长时间跨度，利用间隔效应的力量。时间允许我戴上一副新眼镜，以新的视角复习材料。随着时间的推移，在区分信号和噪声时所需的判断力会更好地揭示出来。

Let time do its magic.

让时间发挥它的魔力。

### Closing Remarks

### 结束语

After proofreading this article I realized this is pretty complicated. I’ve tried to simplify it without losing much detail. I hope it’s not too confusing.

在校对了这篇文章之后，我意识到这是相当复杂的。我试着在不丢失太多细节的情况下简化它。我希望这不会太让人困惑。
